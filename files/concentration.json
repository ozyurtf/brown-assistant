  "afri": "# Africana Studies\n\nThe concentration in Africana Studies critically examines the artistic, historical, literary, and theoretical expressions of the peoples and cultures of Africa and the African Diaspora. Central to the work of students and faculty in the concentration is the close collaboration of artists, scholars, and writers in examining relationships between academic and artistic knowledge about the world and human experience. Concentrators work closely with faculty members in developing new knowledge about the world and human existence through the critical and comprehensive study of the peoples and cultures of Africa and the African Diaspora. Concentrators are encouraged to study abroad in Africa, the Caribbean, and/or Latin America and to acquire language competency in a language other than English spoken in Africa and the diaspora. \nAfricana Studies presents a different conceptual paradigm that connects the global black experience. Africana Studies engages issues about historical and contemporary responses to local and global crises. It engages with how people of color create their own knowledge culturally and politically. It is oftentimes a critique of how forms of knowledge are produced. Concentrators acquire a host of interdisciplinary skills that allow them to ask questions about the world around them, and forms of knowledge production while developing critical analytical skills. Our concentrators deploy these skills in other classes, enriching their own general intellectual development. \nIn order to develop requisite competency in the discipline of Africana Studies, concentrators must complete nine (9) semester-long courses offered by or cross-listed with the Department. Seven (7) courses must have an AFRI prefix or be offered by Africana Studies core faculty. Two (2) courses can be cross-listed. In some cases, Concentrators may petition the Department to accept other appropriate courses. Of these 9 courses, the following Africana Studies courses are **required:**\n  * [AFRI 0090]( \"AFRI 0090\") An Introduction to Africana Studies\n  * [AFRI 1330]( \"AFRI 1330\") Africana Studies Junior Seminar\n  * [AFRI 1360]( \"AFRI 1360\") Africana Studies: Knowledge, Texts and Methodology–Senior Capstone Seminar (Spring ONLY)\n\n​Students studying abroad during the second semester of their junior year will be required to take the seminar during their senior year. If there is a documented conflict with another concentration's senior seminar, students should consult with the DUS.\nThe Department strongly encourages foreign study in Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America. \nThe Department also encourages the acquisition of language competencies, in addition to English, which are spoken in Africa and the diaspora. Since no continental African language is permanently offered at Brown (to date), concentrators who study abroad and acquire certified competency in any African language are welcome to petition the department for competency credit.\n**_For more information about the concentration, please contact_****the _Director of Undergraduate Studies._**\n### Honors in Africana Studies \nAfricana Studies’ concentrators with outstanding academic records (demonstration of excellent research and writing skills from course selections to grades) may be admitted to the department’s Honors Program.\nStudents interested in pursuing honors should identify a faculty sponsor in Africana Studies (chosen from Core Faculty or affiliated faculty after Chair agreement) in their 6th semester and begin working on their thesis project during the summer before their senior year. By the end of the sixth semester, while working in consultation with a faculty advisor, the student must submit a rough draft of the project proposal. **[Please visit the department website for proposal guidelines]( This preliminary plan should include a timeline for completion of the thesis and is not to exceed one (1) typewritten page. This plan should also include a bibliography that students have developed with their thesis advisor to guide their summer reading.\nBy the end of the summer, the Honor’s candidate should be familiar with the secondary works in the field. (Secondary readings should be extensive and be incorporated into the final proposal, due **Monday, September 26, 2022**.) The student should also identify a second reader at this point. The final work plan/proposal, not to exceed three (3) typewritten pages, should incorporate the summer research findings and updates to the completion deadline. The final proposal must be approved and signed by a committee, comprised of the faculty advisor who is to direct the Honor's thesis, the second reader, and the concentration advisor. By the end of week three of the first senior semester, the thesis advisor should inform the Director of Undergraduate Studies by email that the proposal has been approved.\nThe Honor's candidate should complete at least one chapter of distinguished quality while enrolled in an independent study with their faculty advisor during the first semester of the senior year. Students must enroll in at least one, preferably two, semesters of independent study to work on their thesis.\nFor students completing graduation requirements by the end of **Semester I (Fall)** , a first complete draft of the thesis should be completed by **the last****Friday in October**. Final drafts must be submitted by **the last****Friday in November**. For students completing graduation requirements by **Semester II (Spring)** , a first complete draft of the thesis should be submitted by **the last Friday****in February**. The final draft of the thesis should be submitted by **the last Friday****in March.** Students must submit bound copies of the final thesis to the department and to each of their readers, along with an electronic copy of the completed thesis to the Academic Department Manager. All students are expected to formally present their thesis projects in the Department of Africana Studies in **early April** at a time to be determined. After this presentation, a department committee will make recommendations for honors to the Director of Undergraduate Studies and students will receive notification of the recommendation.",
  "cogn": "# Cognitive Neuroscience\n\nCognitive neuroscience is the study of higher cognitive functions in humans and their underlying neural bases. It is an integrative area of study drawing primarily from cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics. There are two broad directions that can be taken in this concentration - one is behavioral/experimental and the other is computational/modeling. In both, the goal is to understand the nature of cognition from a neural perspective. The standard concentration for the Sc.B. degree requires courses on the foundations, systems level, and integrative aspects of cognitive neuroscience as well as laboratory and elective courses that fit within a particular theme or category such as general cognition, perception, language development or computational/modeling. Concentrators must also complete a senior seminar course or an independent research course. Students may also participate in the work of the Brown Institute for Brain Science, an interdisciplinary program that unites ninety faculty from eleven departments.\n### Standard Program for the AB degree\n**_These are the new requirements approved by CCC effective Fall 2024. For existing concentrators graduating in 2024-25, the prior requirements can be found by selecting the Bulletin archive<\n### Common Core\nCareers in Cognitive Neuroscience and related fields require familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Cognitive Neuroscience concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods ([CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\")). [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") is a prerequisite for research methods and laboratory courses, so concentrators should plan to take this course by their fourth semester. Students may substitute for [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") a comparable statistics course taught in another department, with the approval of a Cognitive Neuroscience concentration advisor. Consult with a concentration advisor for details. The department does not grant concentration credit for AP Statistics, regardless of score. We strongly recommend fulfilling the statistics requirement as a sophomore.\nAnother element in the Cognitive Neuroscience concentration is a course on research methods. Research Methods and Design ([CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\")) or Research Methods ([CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\")) is the preferred course for fulfilling this requirement. This course builds on the introductory statistics course and exposes students to a variety of topics in the psychological sciences: to empirical methods (e.g., surveys, chronometry, eye tracking, brain imaging), to common designs (e.g., factorial experimental, correlational, longitudinal), to research ethics, and to best practices of literature review. Other CPSY laboratory courses can be used to fulfill the research methods requirement; consult with a Cognitive Neuroscience advisor for lists of approved courses. The research methods requirement should be fulfilled before senior year. \n### **Foundation**\nThe goal of these requirements is to provide students with the foundational knowledge across Cognitive Neuroscience. Students are expected to have some background in Psychology, in Neuroscience, and in Computation. The requirements below afford students with the opportunity to gain background in each of these foundational areas and cannot be interchanged.\n(A) Students are expected to take two courses that provide them with a foundation in cognition/psychology. The goal of taking courses in this category is to consider general principles of Psychological and Cognitive Science towards the study of Cognitive Neuroscience. The courses below are ones that teach fundamental topics related to Cognitive Neuroscience or that provide foundational knowledge that can be applied to neuroscientific principles and techniques. Cognition, Learning, Perception and Cognitive Neuropsychology are emphasized. Students interested in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience are encouraged to get a background in Cognitive Development (CPSY 0610), while students interested in Social Neuroscience are encouraged to get a background in Social Psychology (CPSY 0700). However, we do not accept both CPSY 0610 and CPSY S0700, as students interested in both of these topics are recommended to concentrate in psychology \n(B) Students are expected to take one course that provides them with a foundation in neuroscience. The goal of taking a course in this category is to become familiar with the principles of cognitive neuroscience research and methods in one of the foundational domains.\nPlease note that CPSY 0400 and CPSY 0450 can be used for either the Foundation in Cognition/Psychology or the Foundation in Neuroscience requirement, but not both. That is, if either of these classes are used for the Foundation in Cognition requirement, students must take NEUR 0010 to satisfy Foundations in Neuroscience requirement; if either CPSY 0400 or CPSY 0450 are used for the Foundation in Neuroscience requirement, students cannot use them (or CPSY 0200) to satisfy the Foundations in Cognition/Psychology requirements.\n(C) Because the study of Cognitive Neuroscience can focus on computational explanations for the relation between neural processes and behavior, students are required to take one course in programming or computational modeling. \n### **Electives**\nThe goal of the elective requirement is to construct a curriculum that provides a deeper understanding of Cognitive Neuroscience. Students should take five electives from the CPSY, NEUR, or CSCI departments, of which three must be at the 1000-level. Courses might also come from the APMA, COST or PHP departments (only with permission of concentration advisor). Extra foundation classes can be used as electives. However, students cannot construct a program of study that includes both CPSY 0950 and an introductory CSCI class as part of this requirement. Moreover, students must have at least three electives at the 1000-level. These elective courses must represent a specific coherent program of study, which is discussed with the concentration advisor.\n### Requirements for the A.B. degree\n[CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") | Statistical Methods | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\") | Research Methods And Design | 1  \nor [CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\") |  Research Methods  \nTwo Foundation Courses in Cognition from the following:  | 2  \n[CPSY 0010]( \"CPSY 0010\") | Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach |   \n[CPSY 0100]( \"CPSY 0100\") | Learning and Conditioning |   \n[CPSY 0200]( \"CPSY 0200\") | Human Cognition |   \nor [CPSY 0400]( \"CPSY 0400\") |  Cognitive Neuroscience  \nor [CPSY 0450]( \"CPSY 0450\") |  Brain Damage and the Mind  \n[CPSY 0500]( \"CPSY 0500\") | Perception and Mind |   \nor [CPSY 0550]( \"CPSY 0550\") |  Science of Consciousness  \n[CPSY 0610]( \"CPSY 0610\") | Children's Thinking: The Nature of Cognitive Development |   \nor [CPSY 0700]( \"CPSY 0700\") |  Social Psychology  \nOne Foundation Course in Neuroscience from the following: | 1  \n[CPSY 0400]( \"CPSY 0400\") | Cognitive Neuroscience |   \n[CPSY 0450]( \"CPSY 0450\") | Brain Damage and the Mind |   \n[NEUR 0010]( \"NEUR 0010\") | The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience |   \nOne Foundation Course in Computation from the following: | 1  \n[CPSY 0950]( \"CPSY 0950\") | Introduction to programming |   \n[CPSY 1291]( \"CPSY 1291\") | Computational Methods for Mind, Brain and Behavior |   \n[CPSY 1492]( \"CPSY 1492\") | Computational Cognitive Neuroscience |   \n[CPSY 1950]( \"CPSY 1950\") | Deep Learning in Brains, Minds and Machines |   \nOr any introductory CSCI course with a programming component such as: |   \n[CSCI 0111]( \"CSCI 0111\") | Computing Foundations: Data |   \nor [CSCI 0150]( \"CSCI 0150\") |  Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science  \nor [CSCI 0170]( \"CSCI 0170\") |  Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction  \nor [CSCI 0190]( \"CSCI 0190\") |  Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science  \nFive Approved Electives: | 5  \nFive courses from the CPSY, NEUR, or CSCI department, of which three must be at the 1000-level |   \nCapstone: Independent Study ([CPSY 1970]( \"CPSY 1970\"), [CPSY 1980]( \"CPSY 1980\")) or approved seminar or lab | 1  \nTotal Credits | 12  \n### Honors Requirement\nThe Honors Program in Cognitive Neuroscience gives undergraduates a special opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member. The program also provides the opportunity for outstanding senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background. \nCandidates for Honors in Cognitive Neuroscience must meet all of the requirements of the concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program in semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a potential faculty mentor prior to semester 7. Candidates for Honors must have completed the Statistics [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") and Research Methods and Design ([CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\"), Research Methods [CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\"), or laboratory course) requirements before semester 7.

Alternatively, students may take an approved laboratory course. \n**_ScB Requirements in Cognitive Neuroscience_**\nTo satisfy the ScB. requirements in the Cognitive Neuroscience concentration, one must satisfy all the AB requirements as well as take five (5) additional classes in STEM fields related to the concentration. The goal of this requirement is to provide students with a broader background in both the study of psychology and STEM fields in general. At least two (2) of those five classes must be in the CPSY Department. These two courses must be at the 1000-level. We strongly recommend that one of these courses be a laboratory course.\nThe other three classes can be from the following departments: APMA, BIOL, CSCI, CHEM, CPSY, MATH, NEUR, or PHYS. Courses from other STEM fields might be eligible with permission of the concentration advisor, but such courses must be related to a student’s other courses, such as their electives. Courses from CPSY must be at the 1000-level to be considered for the Sc.B (no other department has that requirement). All courses must also be acceptable for the concentration requirements of a concentration administered by that department. For example, if a PHYS course is used to satisfy one of these requirements, it must be acceptable for a concentration in the PHYS department. \n[CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") | Statistical Methods | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\") | Research Methods And Design | 1  \nor [CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\") |  Research Methods  \nTwo Foundation Courses in Cognition from the following: | 2  \n[CPSY 0010]( \"CPSY 0010\") | Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach |   \n[CPSY 0100]( \"CPSY 0100\") | Learning and Conditioning |   \n[CPSY 0200]( \"CPSY 0200\") | Human Cognition |   \nor [CPSY 0400]( \"CPSY 0400\") |  Cognitive Neuroscience  \nor [CPSY 0450]( \"CPSY 0450\") |  Brain Damage and the Mind  \n[CPSY 0500]( \"CPSY 0500\") | Perception and Mind |   \n[CPSY 0550]( \"CPSY 0550\") | Science of Consciousness |   \n[CPSY 0610]( \"CPSY 0610\") | Children's Thinking: The Nature of Cognitive Development |   \nor [CPSY 0700]( \"CPSY 0700\") |  Social Psychology  \nOne Foundation Course in Neuroscience from the following: | 1  \n[CPSY 0400]( \"CPSY 0400\") | Cognitive Neuroscience |   \n[CPSY 0450]( \"CPSY 0450\") | Brain Damage and the Mind |   \n[NEUR 0010]( \"NEUR 0010\") | The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience |   \nOne Foundation Course in Computation from the following: | 1  \n[CPSY 0950]( \"CPSY 0950\") | Introduction to programming |   \n[CPSY 1291]( \"CPSY 1291\") | Computational Methods for Mind, Brain and Behavior |   \n[CPSY 1492]( \"CPSY 1492\") | Computational Cognitive Neuroscience |   \n[CPSY 1950]( \"CPSY 1950\") | Deep Learning in Brains, Minds and Machines |   \nOr any introductory CSCI course with a programming component such as: |   \n[CSCI 0111]( \"CSCI 0111\") | Computing Foundations: Data |   \nor [CSCI 0150]( \"CSCI 0150\") |  Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science  \nor [CSCI 0170]( \"CSCI 0170\") |  Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction  \nor [CSCI 0190]( \"CSCI 0190\") |  Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science  \nFive Approved Electives: | 5  \nFive courses from the CPSY, NEUR, or CSCI department, of which three must be at the 1000-level |   \nFive additional STEM courses of which two (2) must be CPSY courses at the 1000-level from the Electives of Capstone offerings (a lab is strongly recommended).

  "arct": "# Architecture\n\nThe Architecture concentration introduces students to a broad understanding of concepts and methods for the planning and design of buildings and urban environments. It connects architectural education firmly to the humanities and provides a greater awareness of historical, global, environmental, social and economic issues in the built environment. This approach to the education of architects and urban planners aims to provide them with the tools needed in today’s fractured urban society. Apart from training careful observation, critical analysis and problem solving, students will acquire skills in sketching, drafting, model-making, and digital rendering. By combining a carefully selected range of classes in architectural design, the humanities, engineering and technology, and urban life and theory, students will acquire necessary proficiency for pursuing a graduate degree in architecture after Brown.\n_NOTE: The Architecture concentration is open for current concentrators and for prospective concentrators admitted to the University in Fall 2024. Starting in Fall 2025, the department will no longer offer this concentration as an option for incoming first year students._ ** _[More information is available here]( _._**](\n### Self-Assessment\nAll concentrators are required to write an essay when they file for the concentration that lays out what they expect to gain from the course of study they propose. All second-semester seniors will be required to write a final essay that takes measure of what they have learned from the concentration, including their capstone and other experiences relating to their study of architecture.

Capstone projects are required for all concentrators. The Capstone is intended to challenge you with an opportunity to synthesize at a high level of achievement the knowledge and understanding you have gained by concentrating in Architecture. Capstone projects embrace many possibilities. You can perfect a studio project or seminar paper in which you have developed a strong interest. You can participate in a graduate seminar to which the instructor has admitted you. You can develop work that you do as a museum or gallery intern. You might work on an archaeological excavation. You can participate in the Honors Program. Beyond these opportunities, the Department is open to other approaches. Capstones are often completed under the auspices of an independent study course. But a capstone may be completed under the umbrella of an existing course. All capstone’s must be discussed with and approved by a faculty sponsor and your concentration advisor. | 1  \nTotal Credits | 12 \n\n1  \n      \nA maximum of four credits may be allowed for courses taken at other universities (transfer credits or from study abroad) or courses on architectural subjects taken in other departments. No concentration credit will be granted for AP/A-level scores.  \n\n2  \n    \nElectives should be chosen in consultation with your concentration advisor.\n### Honors\nDuring the second semester of the junior year all concentrators will be invited to apply for admission to the Honors Program in Architecture. The honors program is an opportunity for you to mobilize what you have learned to make an original research contribution to the field.\nThere are two pathways to honors in the Architecture concentration: thesis and project-based.\nThose pursuing the thesis option research and write a historical or theoretical essay on a topic of their choice over the course of their senior year. The thesis should be no more than 35 pages in length, plus bibliography and illustrations.\nThose pursuing the project option further develop a design project that they initiated in an Intermediate or Advanced Studio in their junior year or in the first semester of their senior year. They devote a minimum of one additional semester further developing their project in regular consultation with a faculty advisor. (This can mean building an additional, more elaborate model, creating more renderings, or refining the concept.)\nStudents wishing to pursue Honors should have produced consistently excellent work and maintained a high level of achievement (i.e. a majority of “A” or “S with distinction” grades) in all concentration courses. Acceptance into the Honors program depends on the persuasiveness of the thesis topic and the availability of relevant faculty to advise the thesis. Students may refine their proposals by speaking in advance with potential advisors. No honors student may take more than four courses either semester of their senior year—with the honors seminar being considered one of the four courses. Students interested in honors who are expecting to graduate in the middle of the year should contact the concentration advisor no later than the beginning of their junior year.\nDuring both fall and spring semesters you will participate in the monthly meetings of the Honors cohort, in which honors students in both HIAA concentrations share their work-in-progress with each other and with the faculty member who supervises the seminar. These monthly meetings, usually three per semester, are mandatory. Students must enroll in [HIAA 1990]( \"HIAA 1990\") (Honors Thesis) in both semesters. S tudents are also expected to meet separately and regularly with their own thesis advisor.\nTheses and projects will be due to the advisor and second reader by March 1 of the Spring semester or by November 1 of the Fall semester if you plan on graduating in December. Comments will be returned to the students for final corrections at that point. There will be a public presentation of Honors work at the end of the Spring semester.",
  "biop": "# Biophysics\n\nBiophysics is a quantitative science at the intersection of the life and physical sciences.

  "clas": "# Classics\n\nThe study of Classics focuses on the languages, literature, history, culture, and legacy of Greco-Roman antiquity. An undergraduate concentration in Classics furnishes students with a broad liberal education, and provides specialized training for those students intending to enter graduate school. Students may choose to study Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and/or Modern Greek, and to explore courses in literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and religion. Students may either pursue the standard Classics concentration – the most popular choice – or one of several optional tracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit, Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit. Concentrators who pursue an honors degree write a senior thesis, typically over the course of two semesters during their senior year.\nBeginning with declarations submitted after September 1, 2018, all tracks except \"Greek and Latin,\" \"Greek and Sanskrit,\" and \"Latin and Sanskrit\" require the satisfactory completion of nine courses as described below. The introductory courses in Greek and Latin may not usually be counted toward a concentration, but those in Sanskrit may be counted toward the concentration requirement in some of the tracks. Students should always consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies regarding their path toward fulfilling requirements and choosing electives.\n### Classics\nOne course in Greek or Latin on the 1000-level or above. 1 | 1  \n---|---  \nSelect any two of the four ancient history courses:  | 2  \n[CLAS 1210]( \"CLAS 1210\") | Mediterranean Culture Wars: Archaic Greek History, c. 1200 to 479 BC |   \n[CLAS 1220]( \"CLAS 1220\") | The Fall of Empires and Rise of Kings: Greek History 478 to 323 BC |   \nor [HIST 1200B]( \"HIST 1200B\") |  The Fall of Empires and Rise of Kings: Greek History to 478 to 323 BCE  \n[CLAS 1310]( \"CLAS 1310\") | Roman History I: The Rise and Fall of an Imperial Republic |   \n[CLAS 1320]( \"CLAS 1320\") | Roman History II: The Roman Empire and Its Impact |   \nor [HIST 1201B]( \"HIST 1201B\") |  Roman History II: The Empire  \nFive other courses in classics, including classical archaeology, Greek (excluding [GREK 0100]( \"GREK 0100\"), [0200]( \"GREK 0200\"), [0110]( \"GREK 0110\")), Latin (excluding [LATN 0100]( \"LATN 0100\"), [0200]( \"LATN 0200\"), [0110]( \"LATN 0110\")), Sanskrit, or related areas to be approved by the concentration advisor.

  "bchm": "# Biochemistry & Molecular Biology\n\nHow does life work at the molecular level? This question is at the core of the concentration program Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In earlier years of this discipline, the focus was on structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and small molecules such as vitamins. Today the logical approach and tools of biochemical science are being expanded to new areas in neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology, pharmacology and synthetic biology (the design of analogs of biological systems). Training in biochemistry begins with a foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Some courses offered in other departments, including engineering, geology and computer science, are also useful. A key component of this program is the year of hands-on research carried out in collaboration with a faculty member here at Brown. Faculty sponsors are drawn from both the Chemistry Department and the Division of Biology and Medicine, and include basic science and clinical faculty.\n### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nStudents must take twenty courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics, including the following core requirements, some of these may be fulfilled with AP credits.\nThree courses in mathematics including two courses in [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\")/[0100]( \"MATH 0100\") or [MATH 0170]( \"MATH 0170\")/[0180]( \"MATH 0180\") with a third class in statistics, math, or computer science 1 | 3  \n---|---  \nOptions for statistics courses include: 1 |   \n[APMA 0650]( \"APMA 0650\") | Introduction to Probability and Statistics |   \n[APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") | Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Calculus |   \n[APMA 1655]( \"APMA 1655\") | Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Theory 3 |   \n[BIOL 0495]( \"BIOL 0495\") | Statistical Analysis of Biological Data |   \n[CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") | Statistical Methods |   \n[PHP 1501]( \"PHP 1501\") | Essentials of Data Analysis |   \n[PHP 1510]( \"PHP 1510\") | Principles of Biostatistics and Data Analysis |   \nTwo courses in physics, typically: 1 | 2  \n[PHYS 0030]( \"PHYS 0030\") | Basic Physics A |   \nor [PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\") |  Foundations of Mechanics  \nor [ENGN 0040]( \"ENGN 0040\") |  Engineering Statics and Dynamics  \n[PHYS 0040]( \"PHYS 0040\") | Basic Physics B |   \nor [PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\") |  Foundations of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics  \nThree courses in physical and organic chemistry: | 3  \n[CHEM 0330]( \"CHEM 0330\") | Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure |   \n[CHEM 0350]( \"CHEM 0350\") | Organic Chemistry I |   \n[CHEM 0360]( \"CHEM 0360\") | Organic Chemistry II |   \nOne course in biophysical chemistry: | 1  \n[CHEM 0400]( \"CHEM 0400\") | Biophysical and Bioinorganic Chemistry |   \nFour courses in biochemistry: | 4  \n[BIOL 0280]( \"BIOL 0280\") | Biochemistry |   \n[BIOL 0285]( \"BIOL 0285\") | Inquiry in Biochemistry: From Gene to Protein Function |   \nPlus two of three upper level biochemistry courses: |   \n[BIOL 1270]( \"BIOL 1270\") | Advanced Biochemistry |   \nor [CHEM 1230]( \"CHEM 1230\") |  Chemical Biology  \nor [CHEM 1240]( \"CHEM 1240\") |  Biochemistry  \nThe two semester research requirement may be satisfied by any two of the following.

for Biochemistry\nAll ScB Biochemistry concentrators are candidates for Honors; no separate application is necessary.\nThe requirements for Honors in Biochemistry are:\n* Students must have a majority of either As or S with distinction grades in concentration courses. \n* Two semesters of Independent Study ([CHEM 0980]( \"CHEM 0980\"), [CHEM 0980S]( \"CHEM 0980S\"), [CHEM 0981]( \"CHEM 0981\"), [BIOL 1950]( or [BIOL 1960]( Guidelines and requirements associated with Independent Study are in the Undergraduate Concentration Handbook which can be found at the department [website](\n* A Thesis in a form approved by the research advisor, and recommended by the research advisor. Additional information about thesis guidelines will be provided by the Concentration Advisor in the first half of the fall semester.\n* An oral presentation of the thesis in a fifteen-minute senior talk followed by a five-minute question and answer period.",
  "amst": "# American Studies\n\nThe concentration in American Studies seeks to understand American society and cultures as emerging from historical and contemporary processes at work in local, national, and global contexts. Concentrators study four broad themes: social structure and the practices of identity, space and place, production and consumption of culture, and science, technology, and everyday life. Study abroad is supported and encouraged.\nInterested students may contact the director of undergraduate studies.\nA concentrator in American Studies will be able to:\n  * Analyze texts, contexts, and data from multiple disciplinary and historical perspectives\n  * Synthesize research as verbal, visual and/or digital presentations\n  * Explore the theory and/or practice of the engagement of scholarship with a broader public\n  * Understand how American society and cultures have been and are being shaped by global flows of people, goods and ideas\n  * Experiment with new media as critical tools for scholarship\n\nConcentrators have gone on to a vast variety of careers, including law, public humanities, politics, public service, academics, business, creative arts, and medicine.\n##### Requirements for the American Studies Concentration\nIn consultation with the Concentration Advisor, each concentrator develops an individualized program of study of **10 courses** (or 12 courses for those completing an Honors Thesis). Three of these courses must be linked to an **individual focus** formulated by the student when the concentration is declared. The focus is the flexible core of the concentration: each student builds a coherent and dynamic interdisciplinary cluster of related courses that develops their compelling interest in some aspect of American experience.\n**Required concentration courses & capstone portfolio:**\n  * **One gateway course** from the AMST 0600 \"Questions\" series.\n  * **Four seminars above the 1000-level, including a Senior Seminar.**\n    * The Senior Seminar is any AMST 1900-series course taken during the senior year. Students may take as many AMST 1900 courses as they wish; however, for the course to count as the Senior Seminar it must be taken during the senior year.\n    * The three other seminars may be listed in American Studies or Ethnic Studies, or in another department if linked to the student's focus area (requires concentration advisor approval; a maximum of 3 courses outside of AMST/ETHN can count toward the concentration).\n  * **Five additional elective courses, four of which must be above the 1000-level.** These may be seminars or lecture courses listed in American Studies or Ethnic Studies, or in another department if linked to the student's focus area (requires concentration advisor approval; a maximum of 3 courses outside of AMST/ETHN can count toward the concentration).\n  * **Senior Capstone ePortfolio (ungraded, detailed below).**\n  * **Honors Thesis (optional)** : Concentrators hoping to pursue honors should take the Honors Seminar, AMST 1800, in the spring of their junior year. AMST 1800 counts as one of the four required 1000-level seminars listed above. Students pursuing honors are also required to take two independent study courses (AMST 1970) in their senior year in order to complete the honors thesis. These independent study courses raise the total number of required concentration courses to 12.\n\n### WHAT we study\nAmerican Studies at Brown is concerned with four broad themes:\n  * Social Structures and the Practices of Identity\n  * Space and Place\n  * Production and Consumption of Culture\n  * Science, Technology, and Everyday Life\n\n### HOW we study\nAmerican Studies at Brown emphasizes four intersecting approaches that are critical tools for understanding these themes:\n  * Cultural and Social Analysis\n  * Global/International Contextualization\n  * New Media Understandings\n  * Publicly Engaged Scholarship\n\n**Courses in the AMST 0600 “Questions” series** introduce students to American Studies by showing how a shared set of core questions can guide the investigation of myriad topics in this interdisciplinary field. Each course in the series engages with at least 3 of the following questions:\n1. How does [subject] shed light on issues of identity, place, and power in the United States?\n2. How does [subject] reveal contestations over citizenship, culture, and belonging in American society?\n3. How does [subject] help us understand histories and practices of social change in the United States?\n4. How does [subject] illuminate the international, transnational, or imperial relations that have shaped American politics and cultural practices?",
  "aran": "# Archaeology and the Ancient World\n\nThe undergraduate concentration in Archaeology and the Ancient World provides students with an opportunity to explore the multi-faceted discipline of archaeology, and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to engaging with the ancient world. While the core focus of Archaeology and the Ancient World at Brown University is archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Near East, this concentration encourages students to reach beyond this geographic area, to engage with Brown’s many strengths in history, epigraphy, art, ethics, engineering, religious studies, and the sciences – to name just a few. The concentration, with its three distinct but overlapping tracks, is intended to allow students flexibility in structuring their own path through this diverse field of study. \nIt is expected that, in completing the requirements for this concentration, students will incorporate courses that offer new perspectives on the complex dynamics of social inequity, exclusion, and difference, and which encourage engagement with the community – both by enrolling in classes designated as Race, Power, and Privilege (RPP) or Community-Based Learning and Research (CBLR), and through other classes that explore similar themes. Research opportunities, through summer fieldwork, internships, museum experience, or independent study projects, are strongly encouraged.\nWithin this concentration, the three tracks are:\n  * **Archaeology and the Ancient World** : the most flexible of the concentration tracks, allowing students to explore any region or time period, and to develop their own areas of focus, such as museum studies, ethics and politics of the past, engineering and materials analysis, cultural heritage, or environmental studies.\n  * **Classical Archaeology** : for those interested chiefly in the ‘classic’ civilizations of the Mediterranean (especially Greece and Rome), as well as for those interested in both earlier (prehistoric) and later (medieval) periods in that geographic region.\n  * **Egyptian and Near Eastern Archaeology** : for those interested chiefly in the cultures of Egypt and the ancient ‘Near East’ – Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia – from prehistoric through Islamic times.\n\nAll three tracks begin with the same foundation. Students are then expected to experiment with and define their own areas of specialty, establishing expertise in topics such as cultural heritage, archaeological theory, or materials analysis, or in particular regions or time periods. The concentration is also designed to allow students to build progressively upon what they have learned, moving from introductory courses to upper-level seminars.\nThe student must take a total of 10 courses, including:\nCORE REQUIREMENTS: |   \n---|---  \nAll three tracks share four Core Requirements: two introductory courses providing an overview of archaeology’s two central aspects (field methodologies, and art history); and two introductory courses in the core geographical focus of the Joukowsky Institute (Classical/Mediterranean archaeology and Egyptian/Near Eastern archaeology). |   \nOne introductory course in archaeological methodology and/or scientific approaches, preferably: | 1  \n[ARCH 0100]( \"ARCH 0100\") | Field Archaeology in the Ancient World |   \n[ANTH 0500]( \"ANTH 0500\") | Past Forward: Discovering Anthropological Archaeology |   \nor a course that addresses similar methodological/scientific topics, which must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

In order to qualify for Honors, students must have received more A’s than B’s in concentration courses completed, and successfully complete an Honors thesis in their final two semesters at Brown. For the preparation of this thesis, students will ordinarily enroll in [ARCH 1970]( \"ARCH 1970\") during the first semester of the senior year and [ARCH 1990]( \"ARCH 1990\") during the second semester of the senior year. These courses may not be taken S/NC, nor may they be used to satisfy the standard requirements of the concentration. \nHonors concentrations are recommended for students considering graduate work in the discipline of archaeology. Any student interested in a course of graduate study should speak to the Director of Undergraduate Studies and faculty members as soon as possible, not least for advice about additional forms of preparation. Graduate work in the archaeology of the ancient world, for example, requires knowledge of appropriate ancient, as well as modern, languages. Students should start work on acquiring these skills as early as possible.\n### The Honors Thesis\nThe Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually of between 40 and 60 pages in length, researched and written under the supervision of a faculty advisor and second reader during the senior year (during which the student must be enrolled in [ARCH 1970]( \"ARCH 1970\") in the Fall and [ARCH 1990]( \"ARCH 1990\") in the Spring semester).\nStudents considering writing an Honors thesis should, in their junior year, identify a faculty member who will serve as thesis advisor, and a second faculty member to serve as second reader. Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both of them, may be in a unit other than the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. During their junior year, students should also identify a specific topic and approach of the thesis, in consultation with the thesis advisor. A preliminary title and one page outline of the proposed Honors thesis is due to the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the thesis advisor by **May 15th** of the junior year.\nIn the Fall semester of their senior year (semester 7), students must register for [ARCH 1970]( \"ARCH 1970\"): Individual Study Project in Old World Archaeology and Art, selecting the section taught by their thesis advisor. The schedule and frequency of meetings between the student and advisor should be determined during the first two weeks of classes. On **October 15th** , a complete outline of the thesis project and a detailed bibliography are due to the advisor and Director of Undergraduate Studies. A full chapter must be turned in to the advisor, second reader, and Director of Undergraduate Studies no later than **December 15th**. Students who do not meet the thesis deadlines in the Fall, or whose work is not considered worthy of Honors as determined by the thesis advisor, will not be able to register for ARCH 1990 in the Spring and will not be permitted to continue work on an Honors thesis. \nIn the Spring semester of their senior year (semester 8), students must register for [ARCH 1990]( \"ARCH 1990\"): Senior Honors Thesis in Archaeology and the Ancient World, selecting the section taught by their thesis advisor. Students must turn in a complete draft of their thesis to their advisor, second reader, and the Director of Undergraduate Studies by **March 15th**. The revised, final version of the thesis is due to the advisor, second reader, and the Director of Undergraduate Studies by **April 15th**. \nThe completed thesis will be evaluated by the advisor and second reader, who will discuss its strengths and weaknesses in a joint meeting with the student; they will then make a recommendation concerning Honors, and also agree a grade for [ARCH 1990]( \"ARCH 1990\").\nThe Honors concentrators will be asked to make a short public presentation about their work, in a joint event usually occurring in early May.\nAn electronic version of the final thesis must be submitted to the Joukowsky Institute via email to joukowsky_institute@brown.edu and to the Director of Undergraduate Studies by **May 1st**. A printed and bound copy of the thesis must be delivered to the Joukowsky Institute by **May 15th**.\n### Evaluation\nThe Director of Undergraduate Studies will review the student’s overall record, in addition to the thesis evaluations. If all requirements have been successfully met, the recommendation will be made that the student graduates with Honors.",

  "anth": "# Anthropology\n\nAnthropology is the study of human beings from all times and all places, offering a holistic, comparative, international, and humanistic perspective. In studying and interpreting the vast range of similarities and differences in human societies and cultures, anthropologists also seek to understand how people themselves make sense of the world in which they live. The Department of Anthropology at Brown is a vibrant, award-winning group of scholars working primarily in the subfields of cultural anthropology, archaeology, and anthropological linguistics. Anthropology is a varied discipline and the Concentration at Brown University reflects that diversity. Students concentrating in Anthropology must declare one of six possible concentration tracks: sociocultural anthropology, archaeology, anthropological linguistics, biological anthropology, medical anthropology, or general anthropology.\nThe department also supports students involved in Engaged Scholarship through the Swearer Center, through which students may pursue an Engaged Scholarship Certificate. Study abroad is also supported and encouraged. Interested students may contact the director of undergraduate studies.\n**_Students who declared a concentration prior to fall 2019 can refer to concentration requirements here:_**[ ](\n### General Anthropology Track\nChoose one foundational course in sociocultural, linguistic anthropology, or medical anthropology: | 1  \n---|---  \n[ANTH 0100]( \"ANTH 0100\") | Introduction to Cultural Anthropology |   \n[ANTH 0300]( \"ANTH 0300\") | Culture and Health |   \n[ANTH 0800]( \"ANTH 0800\") | Sound and Symbols: Introduction to Linguistic Anthropology |   \nChoose one foundational course in archaeology or biological anthropology: | 1  \n[ANTH 0310]( \"ANTH 0310\") | Human Evolution |   \n[ANTH 0500]( \"ANTH 0500\") | Past Forward: Discovering Anthropological Archaeology |   \nChoose one of the following courses in anthropological methodology, to prepare students for further research:  | 1  \n[ANTH 1201]( \"ANTH 1201\") | Introduction to Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis |   \n[ANTH 1621]( \"ANTH 1621\") | Material Culture Practicum |   \n[ANTH 1720]( \"ANTH 1720\") | The Human Skeleton |   \n[ARCH 1900]( \"ARCH 1900\") | The Archaeology of College Hill |   \n[ANTH 1940]( \"ANTH 1940\") | Ethnographic Research Methods |   \n[ANTH 1740]( \"ANTH 1740\") | Paleoethnobotany: Ancient Agriculture to Criminal Investigations |   \nFive additional courses in anthropology of the student's choosing.

Students are urged to seek out extracurricular opportunities that will round out their anthropological studies. Such experiences might include internships, study abroad, field schools, faculty research apprenticeships, and independent projects. Interested students may contact the director of undergraduate studies.\nAnthropology concentrators who are especially interested in making deeper connections between their concentration curriculum and long-term engagement with local communities in Providence and beyond may choose to pursue an Engaged Scholarship designation through the Swearer Center. Engaged scholars combine hands-on experiences such as internships, public service, humanitarian and development work with their academic learning in order to develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, social engagement. While most anthropology courses have some sort of ‘engaged’ element, being an Engaged Scholar in Anthropology means making a commitment to engaging more actively and intensively with the communities in which a student is living.\nAll Anthropology tracks are compatible with the Engaged Scholarship Certificate.\n### Honors\n### Honors\nCandidates for honors should apply to the concentration advisor by the end of their 6th semester, but no later than the 4th week of the 7th semester. An application consists of a thesis proposal of 2-3 pages, describing the major research questions and methods to be used. Candidates will prepare their proposals in close consultation with their primary advisor. Candidates for honors are required to:\n  1. Fulfill the standard concentration requirements. \n  2. Have completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirements by the end of the sixth semester.\n  3. Be in good standing\n  4. Have earned a majority of “A” grades in the concentration. Classes taken S/NC will count as qualifying towards that majority if they are marked “S* with distinction” indicating that had the student taken the course for a grade, the grade would have been an “A.”\n\nHonors candidates will:\n  1. Take two half-credit Anthropology Thesis Workshop courses ([ANTH 1930]( \"ANTH 1930\")) and at least one additional independent study course ([ANTH 1970]( \"ANTH 1970\")) with the thesis advisor, usually in the student’s final semester.\n  2. In consultation with the primary thesis advisor, identify a second reader by the start of the seventh semester.\n  3. Submit an approved honors thesis by the deadline stipulated each year.\n  4. Present the thesis in the Honors Theses Symposium in the Anthropology department.\n\nMore information on honors is available here: <",
  "chem": "# Chemistry\n\nThe Chemistry concentration offers courses and research opportunities that range from fundamental studies involving the characterization and preparation of synthetic and naturally occurring molecules, to interdisciplinary studies at the interfaces of chemistry with biology, medicine, physics, engineering, and nanoscience. As early as their first year, undergraduates are able to work with faculty members on cutting edge research projects. The Sc.B. degree provides a thorough foundation for further graduate study or for entry-level technical positions in the molecular sciences. Students seeking the Sc.B. may either pursue the standard Chemistry concentration or one of two possible tracks: Chemical Biology or Materials Chemistry. Students may also pursue the A.B. degree in Chemistry, which provides a core education in the discipline.\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree\n[CHEM 0330]( \"CHEM 0330\") | Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[CHEM 0350]( \"CHEM 0350\") | Organic Chemistry I | 1  \n[CHEM 0360]( \"CHEM 0360\") | Organic Chemistry II | 1  \n[CHEM 0500]( \"CHEM 0500\") | Inorganic Chemistry | 1  \n[CHEM 0600]( \"CHEM 0600\") | Preparative Chemistry Lab | .5  \n[CHEM 1140]( \"CHEM 1140\") | Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 | 1  \n[CHEM 1150]( \"CHEM 1150\") | Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 1 | 1  \n[CHEM 1160]( \"CHEM 1160\") | Physical Chemistry Laboratory 1 | 1  \nOne upper level CHEM elective. 2 | 1  \nTotal Credits | 8.5 \n\n1  \n      \nNote that the physical chemistry courses ([CHEM 1140]( \"CHEM 1140\"), [CHEM 1150]( \"CHEM 1150\"), [CHEM 1160]( \"CHEM 1160\")) have mathematics and physics prerequisites. \n\n2  \n    \nUpper level chemistry course are any 1000- and 2000- CHEM course.

Chemistry Concentration – a straight Chemistry option, a Chemical Biology track and a Materials Chemistry track. These tracks are not separate concentrations – your degree will still be an Sc.B. in Chemistry. The Chemical Biology track is designed for students who have a strong interest in the interface of chemistry with biology. The Materials Chemistry track is designed for students who have a strong interest in the interface of chemistry with nanoscience and materials science. It is recommended that courses in the concentration be taken for a letter grade, and any decision to take a concentration course S/NC should be made after consultation with a concentration advisor.\n**_Concentrating in Chemistry – Three tracks_**  \nThe required/recommended courses for the three tracks are given below.\n#### ScB Chemistry:\n[CHEM 0330]( \"CHEM 0330\") | Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[CHEM 0350]( \"CHEM 0350\") | Organic Chemistry I | 1  \n[CHEM 0360]( \"CHEM 0360\") | Organic Chemistry II | 1  \n[CHEM 0500]( \"CHEM 0500\") | Inorganic Chemistry | 1  \n[CHEM 0600]( \"CHEM 0600\") | Preparative Chemistry Lab | .5  \nTwo semesters of independent study: | 2  \n[CHEM 0980]( \"CHEM 0980\") | Undergraduate Research 1 |   \nor [CHEM 0981]( \"CHEM 0981\") |  Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated  \n[CHEM 1140]( \"CHEM 1140\") | Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry | 1  \n[CHEM 1150]( \"CHEM 1150\") | Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics | 1  \n[CHEM 1160]( \"CHEM 1160\") | Physical Chemistry Laboratory | 1  \n[MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") or equivalent 2 | 1  \nTwo Physics courses, typically 0030/0040 or 0050/0060 | 2  \nSix electives (at least three must be upper level CHEM courses) 3 | 6  \nTotal Credits | 18.5 \n\n1  \n      \n**Two** semesters of undergraduate research are required for the concentration.

  "bds": "# Behavioral Decision Sciences\n\nLeading to a Bachelor of Arts, the study of decision making at Brown covers descriptive questions like how people, institutions, and nations make judgments and decisions; normative questions about rationality, such as what constitutes the best judgments and decisions; and prescriptive questions, such as how the process of decision making can be improved to make actual decisions closer to optimal ones. By virtue of its broad interdisciplinary nature, the study of decision making covers work found in a variety of more traditional disciplines including psychology, cognitive science, economics, philosophy, computer science, and neuroscience.

The program also provides the opportunity for senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background.\nCandidates for Honors in BDS must meet all of the requirements of the BDS concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program at the beginning of semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a faculty mentor prior to semester 7 and to complete their methods courses and two of their three electives before semester 7. Please refer to the CPSY Honors Program page for detailed information about the specific requirements for the Honors Program in BDS.",

Students studying Computational Neuroscience will learn to use computational models of the brain and nervous system to study complex biological processes and overcome the limitations of human experimentation. They will also learn to use the brain and nervous system as a model to improve the power and efficiency of artificial systems. Concentrators will think critically about the impact of their work on society and understand how biases can negatively influence computational models.\n### **Standard program for the Sc.B.

  "coeg": "# Computer Engineering\n\nComputer engineers design computer hardware (from chips to servers), communication and network systems, and the smart digital devices that continue to revolutionize how we live and work. They also write the software to run these systems, constantly innovating to improve performance to meet our growing technological needs. They are at the forefront of cybersecurity, machine intelligence, networking, embedded systems, and robotics. They are proficient in both electrical engineering and computer science and are employed in every industry or field that requires computer hardware.\nThe Computer Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, [ The Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) of the CE undergraduate program strives to prepare graduates who: (1) will succeed as leaders in the computer engineering and technology industry and in research and development positions within industry and academia; (2) will work effectively in a range of roles to solve problems with global, economic, environmental and societal impacts; and (3) will pursue lifelong learning through advanced degrees and professional development opportunities throughout their chosen career. The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nThe Computer Engineering concentration shares much of the core with the other engineering programs, but is structured to include more courses in computer science and a somewhat different emphasis in mathematics. \nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures.) In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n1.

To request approval, please complete the online form available at <\n**Special Sc.B. Concentrations (non-accredited):**\nIn addition to the standard programs described above, students may also petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue a special engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such special Sc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited. Students with a special concentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specific area of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B. concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study in engineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not covered by one of the existing Sc.B. programs. Accordingly, special concentration programs are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses with breadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree. A total of 21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required. The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2 courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering. At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses, and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, which must be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineering faculty. Note that not all Engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B. requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward the A.B. will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with an engineering faculty advisor, who will submit the petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Petitions must include: (i) a statement of the objectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the courses in the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for any courses in the program that are not part of standard Sc.B. Engineering concentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent study courses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty advisor for this course; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript.\n### Professional Track\nThe requirements for all undergraduate professional tracks within concentrations are standardized and additional information can be found here:\n<\n**Degrees with Honors in Engineering**\nHonors are granted by the University to students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstrated superior quality and culminated in an 'Honors Thesis of Distinction.' Honors recipients in the School of Engineering must meet the following criteria: (1) Demonstrate a strong academic record (60% A’s or “S with Distinction” in their concentration through the seventh semester); (2) Propose and execute an independent research project under the guidance of a faculty member; (3) Complete a written thesis to the satisfaction of the Honors Program Committee; (4) Give a scientific/technical presentation at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring semester; and (5) Fulfill all deadlines for applying for or completing honors to the satisfaction of his/her research advisor and the Honors Program Committee.",
  "apme": "# Applied Mathematics-Economics\n\nThe Applied Mathematics-Economics concentration is designed to reflect the mathematical and statistical nature of modern economic theory and empirical research. This concentration has two tracks. The first is the advanced economics track, which is intended to prepare students for graduate study in economics. The second is the mathematical finance track, which is intended to prepare students for graduate study in finance, or for careers in finance or financial engineering. Both tracks have A.B. degree versions and Sc.B. degree versions, as well as a Professional track option. If you are interested in declaring a concentration in Applied Mathematics-Economics, please refer to this page for more information regarding the process.\n### Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts \nPrerequisites: |   \n---|---  \n[MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") | Single Variable Calculus, Part II |   \n[MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") | Linear Algebra |   \nCourse Requirements: |   \nApplied Mathematics Requirements - six courses | 6  \nEconomics Requirements: seven courses | 7  \nSee applicable track for specific requirements |   \nTotal Credits | 13  \n### Honors \nApplied Math-Economics concentrators who wish to pursue honors must find a primary faculty thesis advisor in either Economics or Applied Math.

  "apma": "# Applied Mathematics\n\nApplied Mathematics has a profound impact on our daily lives. Whether it is search engines, climate modeling, weather forecasts, artificial intelligence, secure online shopping, brain imaging, or movie recommendations, none of these would work the way they do without algorithms and tools from the mathematical sciences. More generally, Applied Mathematics is an inherently interdisciplinary subject, covering problems arising in all areas of science, technology, and engineering. Our courses provide a broad qualitative and quantitative background for use in these fields.\nApplied Mathematics appeals to people with a variety of different interests, ranging from those with a desire to obtain a good quantitative background for use in some future career, to those who wish to have a better understanding of the basic mathematical aspects of other fields, or to those who are interested in the fundamental mathematical techniques and approaches in themselves. The program stresses but is not limited to scientific computing, differential equations, probability, and statistics, which are areas of mathematics that are used most often in applications in science, society, and industry. Our curriculum is flexible enough to meet the goals and interests of a very wide range of students.\nStudents take courses in applied mathematics for many reasons, not necessarily with an applied mathematics concentration in mind. The value of learning about applied mathematics goes beyond a career opportunity. It provides an education in the use of quantitative methods in thinking about and solving problems, knowledge that is valuable in all walks of life.\nWe offer four concentrations for undergraduates: Applied Mathematics (A.B. & Sc.B.), Applied Mathematics-Biology (Sc.B.), Applied Mathematics-Computer Science (Sc.B.), Applied Mathematics-Economics (A.B. & Sc.B.). This page describes the concentration in Applied Mathematics.\nThe concentration in Applied Mathematics is the most flexible of all of our concentrations. Students are required to build a foundation in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and basic computer programming. Beyond these foundations, there is a great deal of flexibility as to which areas of mathematics and which areas of applications are pursued. Both the A.B. and the Sc.B. allow students to earn concentration credit by taking advanced courses in almost any of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) disciplines. The purpose is to encourage students to develop expertise in both mathematics and an applied area that might be amenable to mathematical investigation.\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree.\nPrerequisites - the equivalent of two semesters of single-variable calculus |   \n---|---  \nSingle-variable calculus is not an enforced requirement for our concentration, but it is a required prerequisite for many of our courses.

The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1)- (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra) or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures). In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n1.

Concentrations (non-accredited)**\nIn addition to the standard program described above, students may also petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue a special engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such special Sc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited. Students with a special concentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specific area of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B. concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study in engineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not covered by one of the existing Sc.B. programs. Accordingly, special concentration programs are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses with breadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree. A total of 21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required. The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2 courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering. At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses, and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, which must be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineering faculty. Note that not all Engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B. requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward the A.B. will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with an engineering faculty advisor, who will submit the petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Petitions must include: (i) a statement of the objectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the courses in the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for any courses in the program that are not part of standard Sc.B. Engineering concentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent study courses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty advisor for this course; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript.\n### Professional Track\nThe requirements for all undergraduate professional tracks within concentrations are standardized and additional information can be found here:\n<\n**Degrees with Honors in Engineering**\nHonors are granted by the University to students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstrated superior quality and culminated in an 'Honors Thesis of Distinction.' Honors recipients in the School of Engineering must meet the following criteria: (1) Demonstrate a strong academic record (60% A’s or “S with Distinction” in their concentration through the seventh semester); (2) Propose and execute an independent research project under the guidance of a faculty member; (3) Complete a written thesis to the satisfaction of the Honors Program Committee; (4) Give a scientific/technical presentation at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring semester; and (5) Fulfill all deadlines for applying for or completing honors to the satisfaction of his/her research advisor and the Honors Program Committee.",
  "apmc": "# Applied Mathematics-Computer Science\n\nThe Sc.B. concentration in Applied Math-Computer Science provides a foundation of basic concepts and methodology of mathematical analysis and computation and prepares students for advanced work in applied mathematics, computer science, and data science.

The following options can be used to satisfy this requirement:\n(a) A pre-approved course that satisfies the APMA Sc.B. capstone requirement: currently APMA 1360, APMA 193*/194* (where * is any combination of numbers and letters; these are the APMA senior seminars).\n(b) Completion of a CS capstone as described in the [CS Concentration Handbook at this link]( Usually, this involves taking one of the [approved CS capstone courses at this link]( and registering the capstone with the instructor of the course and with the CS department using the form linked at the top of the CS capstone courses page. Depending on the course it may require the completion of an additional project.\n(c) A directed research/independent study course from the APMA 1970/1971 or CSCI 1970/1973 series that is used for undergraduate research. For students pursuing honors in APMA-CS, one of the two required semesters of independent study courses can be used.\n(d) A directed research/independent study course in a related discipline (i.e. STEM disciplines, ENVS, PHP, etc.) that is used for undergraduate research if the project is relevant to the student's learning goals in the concentration and with approval from the concentration advisor.\n(e) An upper-level course related to the concentration (usually a 1000-level or higher APMA, CSCI, or MATH course) in addition to a research experience equivalent in scope and scale to work the student would pursue in an Applied Math and Computer Science research-related independent study course. Examples include UTRAs, LINK awards, REUs, research programs at other institutions, the APMA Directed Reading Program, etc. This requires approval from the concentration advisor and appropriate documentation that should be uploaded to ASK. The research experience must be completed during the student’s senior year or the summer before the student’s senior year. Exceptions require prior approval from the concentration advisor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in CS.\n### Professional Track\nThe requirements for all undergraduate professional tracks within concentrations are standardized and additional information can be found here:\n<\n### Honors\nConcentrators that demonstrate excellence in grades and in undergraduate research can be awarded departmental honors.

  "apmb": "# Applied Mathematics-Biology\n\nBiology, the science of all life and living matter, is an incredibly diverse discipline offering students the opportunity to learn about topics ranging from the fundamental chemical reactions that fuel all living organisms to the population dynamics of entire ecosystems all the way to the question of how our brains give rise to the complexities of human cognition and experience. Applied mathematics is an increasingly important component of modern biological investigation. Modern technologies have enabled the creation of vast new biological data sets that often require sophisticated mathematical and statistical models for interpretation and analysis. Advances in computing have similarly enabled the simulation of biological phenomena at increasingly fine levels of detail. Entire subfields, such as bioinformatics and computational neuroscience, have developed around these new paradigms of biological investigation. The foundations of these new fields are inherently mathematical, with a focus on probability, statistical inference, and systems dynamics.\nThe Applied Mathematics – Biology concentration allows students to develop complementary expertise in biology and applied mathematics. Students will focus their advanced biological coursework in an area of particular interest to them. The applied math requirements emphasize those areas of mathematics that have found widespread use throughout all of the biological sciences. The program culminates in a senior capstone experience that enables students to participate in creative research collaborations with faculty.\n###  Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nPrerequisites – the equivalent of two semesters of single-variable calculus |   \n---|---  \nSingle-variable calculus is not an enforced requirement for our concentration, but it is a required prerequisite for many of our courses. At Brown, single-variable calculus consists of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") followed by one of [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\"), [MATH 0170]( \"MATH 0170\"), or [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\"). |   \nRequirements – 16 courses 1 |   \nMathematical Requirements – 7 courses |   \n[MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") | Multivariable Calculus 2 | 1  \nor [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") |  Multivariable Calculus (Physics/Engineering)  \nor [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") |  Multivariable Calculus With Theory  \n[MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") | Linear Algebra 2 | 1  \nor [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") |  Linear Algebra With Theory  \nAPMA 0355 |  Applied Ordinary Differential Equations with Theory 3 | 1  \nAPMA 0365 |  Applied Partial Differential Equations I with Theory 4 | 1  \n[APMA 1655]( \"APMA 1655\") | Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Theory 5 | 1  \n[APMA 1070]( \"APMA 1070\") | Quantitative Models of Biological Systems | 1  \n[APMA 1080]( \"APMA 1080\") | Inference in Genomics and Molecular Biology | 1  \nor [NEUR 2110]( \"NEUR 2110\") |  Statistical Neuroscience  \nScientific Requirements – 7 courses |   \nOne approved course (or course grouping) covering Newtonian mechanics.  6 | 1  \n[CHEM 0330]( \"CHEM 0330\") | Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure | 1  \n[BIOL 0200]( \"BIOL 0200\") | The Foundation of Living Systems 7 | 1  \nTwo BIOL or NEUR courses. 8 | 2  \nTwo 1000-level or higher BIOL or NEUR courses from the same Biology track. 8,9 | 2  \nAdditional Requirements – 2 courses |   \nOne approved course in the mathematical, biological, or computational sciences. 10 | 1  \nOne approved capstone, senior seminar, or research-related course in the mathematical or biological sciences. 11 | 1  \nTotal Credits | 16 \n\n1  \n      \nA required course may be replaced by a more advanced course with concentration advisor approval. No course may be used to satisfy multiple concentration requirements. Transfer credits and courses receiving placement credit notation can satisfy concentration credit as long as they appear on the Brown internal transcript. Pursuing honors will require 17 courses – these 16 along with two semesters of independent study courses for the honors research project, one of which can be used to satisfy the capstone concentration requirement. For students with multiple concentrations: calculus, linear algebra, one intro CSCI course, and at most two additional courses can be used for concentration credit in the other concentration(s). \n\n2  \n    \n[APMA 0260]( \"APMA 0260\") can substitute for the multivariable calculus and/or the linear algebra requirements. If it is used as a substitute for both requirements, then students must take one additional approved 1000-level APMA or MATH course not used elsewhere for concentration credit that adheres to the restrictions in footnote 10 and these additional restrictions: [APMA 1910]( \"APMA 1910\"), APMA 1920, MATH 1090, MATH 1910 and research/independent study courses cannot be used. \n\n3  \n    \n[MATH 1110]( \"MATH 1110\") may be used in place of APMA 0355. If [MATH 1110]( \"MATH 1110\") is used, then the concentration must include at least three 1000-level APMA courses that adhere to the restrictions in footnote 10. These can appear anywhere in the declaration. Students matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use [APMA 0330]( \"APMA 0330\") or [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") as a substitute for APMA 0355. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use [APMA 0330]( \"APMA 0330\") or [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") must also complete the APMA 0355 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  \n\n4  \n    \n[MATH 1120]( \"MATH 1120\") may be used in place of APMA 0365. If [MATH 1120]( \"MATH 1120\") is used, then the concentration must include at least three 1000-level APMA courses that adhere to the restrictions in footnote 10. These can appear anywhere in the declaration. Students matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use [APMA 0340]( \"APMA 0340\") or [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") as a substitute for APMA 0365. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use [APMA 0340]( \"APMA 0340\") or [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") must also complete the APMA 0365 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  \n\n5  \n    \nStudents matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") as a substitute for [APMA 1655]( \"APMA 1655\"). Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") must also complete the APMA 1655 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  \n\n6  \n    \n[PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\") or [PHYS 0070]( \"PHYS 0070\") are recommended. The following course(s) are automatically approved: [PHYS 0030]( \"PHYS 0030\"), [PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\"), [PHYS 0070]( \"PHYS 0070\"), [ENGN 0040]( \"ENGN 0040\") + (one of [PHYS 0040]( \"PHYS 0040\"), [PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\"), a score of 3 or higher on any AP Physics, a score of 4 or higher on IB-HL Physics). When considering alternative course(s) a key criterion is whether both statics and dynamics are covered. \n\n7  \n    \nA BIOL placement test score of 30 or higher may be used in place of [BIOL 0200]( \"BIOL 0200\"). The placement test score can be found in ASK, in the advising detail view, under the test scores section. This will reduce by 1 credit the number of credits needed to complete the concentration. \n\n8  \n    \nMixing BIOL and NEUR courses is fine. Students are encouraged to take at least one laboratory or fieldwork course. \n\n9  \n    \nThe tracks (tracks, not areas) are listed at this [link to the Biology Bulletin page]( at the end of the Biology ScB requirements. The physical sciences track is not allowed. If the biomedical informatics track is used, then one of the courses must be [BIOL 1565]( \"BIOL 1565\"). Substitutions or the use of 2000-level courses requires approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Biology. \n\n10  \n    \n1000-level courses in APMA, BIOL, CSCI, MATH, NEUR are automatically approved, including [APMA 1910]( \"APMA 1910\"), APMA 1920.

At most one of APMA 1910, MATH 1090, MATH 1910, at most one of APMA 1000, APMA 1001, [MATH 1000]( \"MATH 1000\"), [MATH 1001]( \"MATH 1001\"), and at most one of [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\"), [APMA 1655]( \"APMA 1655\"), [CSCI 1450]( \"CSCI 1450\"), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\"), [MATH 1610]( \"MATH 1610\") can be used for concentration credit. Concentrators are strongly encouraged to use this requirement to develop their computer programming skills and to do so before the end of sophomore semester. Many upper-level APMA courses, including [APMA 1080]( \"APMA 1080\"), require exposure to programming as a prerequisite. The following courses are automatically approved for this purpose: [APMA 0160]( \"APMA 0160\"), [APMA 0200]( \"APMA 0200\"), [CSCI 0111]( \"CSCI 0111\"), [CSCI 0150]( \"CSCI 0150\"), [CSCI 0170]( \"CSCI 0170\"), [CSCI 0190]( \"CSCI 0190\"), [CSCI 0200]( \"CSCI 0200\"), [CPSY 0950]( \"CPSY 0950\") , [EEPS 0250]( \"EEPS 0250\"). \n\n11  \n    \nThe following options can be used to satisfy this requirement\n(a) A pre-approved course that satisfies the APMA Sc.B. capstone requirement: currently [APMA 1360]( \"APMA 1360\"), APMA 193*/194* (where * is any combination of numbers and letters; these are the APMA senior seminars).\n(b) A pre-approved course that satisfies the Biology A.B. capstone requirement: currently [BIOL 1100]( \"BIOL 1100\"), [BIOL 1140]( \"BIOL 1140\"), [BIOL 1150]( \"BIOL 1150\"), [BIOL 1250]( \"BIOL 1250\"), [BIOL 1330]( \"BIOL 1330\"), [BIOL 1515]( \"BIOL 1515\"), [BIOL 1525]( \"BIOL 1525\"), [BIOL 1555]( \"BIOL 1555\"), [BIOL 1565]( \"BIOL 1565\"), [BIOL 1575]( \"BIOL 1575\"), [BIOL 1600]( \"BIOL 1600\"), [BIOL 1820]( \"BIOL 1820\"), BIOL 1970.

Documentation should be uploaded to ASK.\n### Professional Track\nThe requirements for all undergraduate professional tracks within concentrations are standardized and additional information can be found here:\n<\n### Honors\nConcentrators that demonstrate excellence in grades and in undergraduate research can be awarded departmental honors. Honors students with primary advisors in Applied Math should follow the guidelines, requirements, and deadlines for honors as described in the [bulletin for Applied Math concentrators]( and as published on the [APMA departmental website]( Honors students with primary advisors in Biomed should follow the guidelines, requirements, and deadlines for honors as described in the [bulletin for Biology concentrators]( and as published on the [Biology departmental website]( Students wishing to do honors research with a non-APMA or Biomed advisor should contact the Directors of Undergraduate Studies in APMA and Biology to discuss options.",
  "cogs": "# Cognitive Science\n\n### Concentration Requirements\nCognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind. Research in Cognitive Science uses behavioral experimentation, computational modeling, and brain imaging to study mental representations and processes. The study of Cognitive Science involves integrating certain areas of focus within Psychology with methods and topics from other disciplines, such as Computer Science, Neuroscience, Linguistics, Philosophy, Anthropology, and Sociology. The goal of the Cognitive Science concentration is to provide students with the foundational background in those areas of psychological science that are fundamental to the field, as well as exposure to the other disciplines that involve the study of the mind. Students can choose to focus on behavioral experimentation or computational modeling with their choice of core classes, and can focus on a particular avenue of study with their electives. \n**_These are the new requirements approved by CCC effective Fall 2024. For existing concentrators graduating in 2024-25, the prior requirements can be found by selecting the Bulletin archive<\n### Common Core\nCareers in Cognitive Science and related fields require familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Psychology concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods ([CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\")). [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") is a prerequisite for research methods and laboratory courses, so concentrators should plan to take this course by their fourth semester. Students may substitute [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") with a comparable statistics course taught in another department with the approval of a Cognitive Science concentration advisor. Consult with a concentration advisor for details. The department does not grant concentration credit for AP Statistics, regardless of score. We strongly recommend fulfilling the statistics requirement as a sophomore.\nAnother element in the Cognitive Science concentration is a course on research methods. This course could focus on behavioral research methods or computational methods. One of Research Methods and Design ([CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\")) or Research Methods ([CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\")) is the preferred way of fulfilling this requirement if students are interested in behavioral methods. One of the laboratory courses in computation (CPSY 1291 or CPSY 1492) is the preferred course for fulfilling this requirement if students are more interested in computational methods. These courses expose students to a variety of topics and methods in Cognitive Science. Other laboratory courses can be used to fulfill the research methods requirement; consult with a Cognitive Science advisor for lists of approved courses. The research methods requirement should be fulfilled before senior year. \n### **Foundation**\nThe goal of the foundation courses is to provide students with a background in the relevant areas of psychological science related to Cognitive Science, as well as provide students with exposure to computational training and foundational knowledge in at least one other discipline related to the study of the mind.\n(A) Three of these foundational courses will be in the CPSY department, specifically providing students with foundations in the psychological sciences related to Cognitive Science. The goal of the foundational courses in the psychological sciences is to provide students with the background in areas of psychology relevant to the study of the mind. This includes cognition, perception, psycholinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience as well as the possibility to study developmental cognitive science or social cognitive science. No student in cognitive science is expected to know all of these topics; rather, the expectation is that students have exposure to a subset of these fields. \nNote however, that we do not accept both CPSY 0610 and CPSY 0700 for the Cognitive Science concentration; students interested in both of these courses are recommended to concentrate in Psychology. Moreover, given the emphasis that some of these courses place on cognitive neuropsychology, one further restriction to these requirements is that students cannot specifically take CPSY 0010, CPSY 0200, and CPSY 0450 to satisfy this foundation requirement. All other combinations are acceptable.\n(B) One foundation course must be outside of the CPSY department. The goal of this requirement is to provide students with exposure to fields related to the study of the mind, not in psychology. These courses contribute to a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of the mind.\n(C) Because the study of cognitive science has a fundamental relation with computational modeling and understanding the computational model of the mind, it is critical that all cognitive science students be familiar with computation and programming. The goal of this last foundation requirement is to provide students with this knowledge base. Note that if students use CPSY1291 or CPSY1492 to satisfy this requirement, they must use a different course to satisfy the research methods requirement listed above.\n### **Electives**\nThe goal of the elective requirement is to construct a curriculum that provides a deeper understanding of Cognitive Science. Students should take four classes in CPSY, PHIL, NEUR, SOC, ANTH, LING, or CSCI with at least one of these classes coming from the CPSY department at the 1000-level and at least two others at the 1000-level. Permission of concentration advisor required to approve electives. No more than two 1970/1980 credits can count towards electives (or requirements to the concentration in general).\n### Requirements for the A.B. degree\n[CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") | Statistical Methods | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\") | Research Methods And Design | 1  \nor [CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\") |  Research Methods  \nThree Foundation Courses within CPSY: | 3  \n[CPSY 0010]( \"CPSY 0010\") | Mind, Brain and Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Approach |   \n[CPSY 0200]( \"CPSY 0200\") | Human Cognition |   \nor [CPSY 0220]( \"CPSY 0220\") |  Making Decisions  \n[CPSY 0400]( \"CPSY 0400\") | Cognitive Neuroscience |   \nor [CPSY 0450]( \"CPSY 0450\") |  Brain Damage and the Mind  \n[CPSY 0500]( \"CPSY 0500\") | Perception and Mind |   \nor [CPSY 0550]( \"CPSY 0550\") |  Science of Consciousness  \n[CPSY 0610]( \"CPSY 0610\") | Children's Thinking: The Nature of Cognitive Development |   \nor [CPSY 0700]( \"CPSY 0700\") |  Social Psychology  \n[CPSY 0800]( \"CPSY 0800\") | Language and the Mind |   \nOne Foundation Course Outside of CPSY: | 1  \n[LING 0100]( \"LING 0100\") | Introduction to Linguistics |   \n[NEUR 0010]( \"NEUR 0010\") | The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience |   \n[SOC 0010]( \"SOC 0010\") | Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology |   \nOr choose from a set of approved courses in PHIL, ANTH, or SOC |   \nOne Foundation Course in Computation: | 1  \n[CPSY 0950]( \"CPSY 0950\") | Introduction to programming |   \n[CPSY 1291]( \"CPSY 1291\") | Computational Methods for Mind, Brain and Behavior |   \n[CPSY 1492]( \"CPSY 1492\") | Computational Cognitive Neuroscience |   \n[CPSY 1950]( \"CPSY 1950\") | Deep Learning in Brains, Minds and Machines |   \nOr any introductory CSCI course with a programming component such as: |   \n[CSCI 0111]( \"CSCI 0111\") | Computing Foundations: Data |   \nor [CSCI 0150]( \"CSCI 0150\") |  Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science  \nor [CSCI 0170]( \"CSCI 0170\") |  Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction  \nor [CSCI 0190]( \"CSCI 0190\") |  Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science  \nFour Approved Electives related to Cognitive Science, such as: | 4  \nStudents should take four courses from CPSY, PHIL, NEUR, SOC, ANTH, LING, or CSCI with at least one of these classes coming from CPSY at 1the 1000-level and at least two others at the 1000-level. |   \nCapstone: Independent Study ([CPSY 1970]( \"CPSY 1970\"), [CPSY 1980]( \"CPSY 1980\")) or approved seminar | 1  \nTotal Credits | 12  \n### Honors Requirement\nThe Honors Program in Cognitive Science gives undergraduates a special opportunity to carry out a research project under the direction of a faculty member. The program also provides the opportunity for outstanding senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background. \nCandidates for Honors in Cognitive Science must meet all of the requirements of the concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program in semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a potential faculty mentor prior to semester 7. Candidates for Honors must have completed the Statistics and Research Methods requirements before semester 7. Please refer to the CPSY Honors Program page for detailed information about the specific requirements for the Honors program in Cognitive Science. \n### Requirements for the Sc.B. degree\nCognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind.

Permission of concentration advisor required to approve electives. No more than two 1970/1980 credits can count towards electives (or requirements to the concentration in general).\n**Research Methods and Capstone**\nAnother element in the Cognitive Science concentration is a research methods course that builds on the introductory statistics course (which will be a prerequisite) but exposes students to a variety of topics in research of the mind: to empirical methods (e.g., surveys, chronometry, eye tracking, brain imaging), to common designs (e.g., factorial experimental, correlational, longitudinal), to research ethics, and to best practices of literature review. Concentrators will additionally take either a seminar course or an independent research course to serve as their capstone experience.\n### **_ScB Requirements in Cognitive Science_**\nTo satisfy an ScB. in the Cognitive Science concentration, one must satisfy all the AB requirements as well as take five (5) additional classes in STEM fields related to the concentration. The goal of this requirement is to provide students with a broader background in both the study of psychology and STEM fields in general. At least two (2) of those five classes must be in the CPSY Department. These two courses must be at the 1000-level. We strongly recommend that one of these courses be an advanced laboratory course (Described above).\nThe other three classes can be from the following departments: APMA, BIOL, CSCI, CHEM, CPSY, MATH, NEUR, or PHYS. Courses from other fields might be eligible with permission of the concentration advisor, but such courses must be related to a student’s other courses, such as their electives.

  "enbi": "# Biomedical Engineering\n\nBiomedical Engineering ([ is a dynamic and growing field based upon the application of the tools of engineering to the subject matter of biology and medicine. The undergraduate program in biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration structured as a joint program between the Division of Biology and Medicine and the School of Engineering. Students can take courses from and do research with faculty from engineering, the various departments of biology, and the Brown-affiliated hospitals in Rhode Island. The Biomedical Engineering (BME) concentration shares much of the core with the other engineering programs, but the program’s primary emphasis is on the fundamentals of biomedical engineering, while also allowing students to personalize their curriculum. Biomedical engineers design new drugs, genetically engineer organisms, and devise new medical devices and instruments. They also use their understanding of biology to advance synthetic and naturally-derived materials and products. BME students learn to apply the principles of engineering and science, along with problem solving skills and critical thinking to a broad spectrum of engineering problems. Further, BME is a sound foundation for lifelong education with its emphasis on the use of teamwork, effective communication skills, and an understanding of broad social, ethical, economic and environmental consequences. The biomedical engineering curriculum at Brown prepares students for careers in biomedical engineering and biotechnology, as well as careers in diverse areas such as medicine, law, business, and health care delivery.\nThe Sc.B. program in Biomedical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET < It is jointly offered by the School of Engineering and the Division of Biology and Medicine as an interdisciplinary concentration designed for students interested in applying the methods and tools of engineering to the life sciences and medicine. Alumni of the Biomedical Engineering (BME) program will achieve one or more of these program educational objectives (PEOs) within five (5) years of graduation: (1) Serve society through work or advanced study in a broad range of fields including, but not limited to, medicine, healthcare, industry, government, and academia; (2) Apply their deeply creative and versatile biomedical engineering education to solve a broad spectrum of engineering and societal challenges; and (3) Contribute as role models, mentors, or leaders in their fields. The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, available online at < The Biomedical Engineering concentration shares much of the core with the other engineering programs and is structured to include more science courses and electives that introduce cutting edge areas in the field of BME.\nThe requirements regarding Mathematics, Advanced Placement, Transfer Credit, Substitutions for Required Courses, and Humanities and Social Science Courses are identical to those of the Sc.B. degree programs in Engineering.

  "eps": "# Earth and Planetary Science\n\nEarth and Planetary Science is a highly interdisciplinary concentration employing principles from physics, chemistry, and biology to understand processes on and in the Earth and other planetary bodies. Concentrators can study Earth and planetary interiors, including the formation of rocks and minerals, movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates, and mountain building and volcanism. Other areas emphasize surface processes, such as coastal erosion, formation of water resources, and desertification. This concentration is a good choice for students who seek a broad scientific understanding of the processes that shape the physical world around us.\nBoth A.B. and Sc.B. degrees are offered, requiring 12 and 19 courses, respectively. These degrees build skills in critical thinking, data analysis and modeling, finding solutions to complex problems, and written and oral communication. DEEPS provides a highly collaborative learning environment that emphasizes process-oriented, hands-on approaches in the classroom, in labs and on field trips. There are many opportunities for students to do paid research during the summer or academic year.\nStudents interested in this concentration may also wish to consider related concentrations: Earth, Climate and Biology, Geophysics and Climate Physics, and Geochemistry and Environmental Chemistry.\n**_Note - For students still enrolled with the prior Concentration in Geological Sciences A.B., please refer to the Archived Bulletin link on left hand navigation for your requirements for the year you declared._**\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree\nThis program provides a broad introduction to the geosciences. It is recommended for students seeking to combine diverse educational interests with a general understanding of Earth processes and Earth history.

  "emow": "# Early Modern World\n\nThe Center for the Study of the Early Modern World promotes interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to historical cultures around the world between the waning of feudalism and the arrival of global industrial capitalism, from the 1300s to the end of the 1800s. Characterized by new global aspirations as well as new modes of domination, resistance, and conflict, this period yielded significant technological transformations and cultural inventions whose study contributes to the historical understanding of the modern world.\nStudents take courses in a wide range of departments in the humanities and social sciences and from faculty affiliated with the Center. Students are invited to take advantage of this breadth of offerings in order to enhance their understanding of the period as well as to gain a sense of the uses, limitations, and interrelationships of particular disciplinary approaches.\n\n**Requirements**\nConcentrators are required to take a minimum of eight courses. These include the following:\n  * Three courses on early modern topics in one field in which the student has primary interest or training, e.g., literature, history of art and architecture, or history.\n  * Three courses related to the early modern period chosen from two other fields.\n  * A senior project. The senior project constitutes the capstone for all concentrators. Examples of possible senior projects include a senior thesis (roughly equivalent to a senior seminar paper), the staging of an early modern play, the performance of early modern music, or an exhibition. The final project will be developed in consultation with two faculty advisors who work closely with the student. Credit is granted through registration for Independent Study in the department for which the topic of research lies.\n  * Other relevant courses of the student's choosing.\n\nIn addition, the student must be able to demonstrate a reading knowledge of a relevant modern or ancient language other than English. This language requirement does not count as one of the eight courses.\nUnder the supervision of the director of the program, students may choose courses from the following:  |   \n---|---  \n[HIAA 0062]( \"HIAA 0062\") | Dutch and Flemish Art: Visual Culture of the Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century |   \n[ENGL 0100C]( \"ENGL 0100C\") | Altered States |   \n[ENGL 0150D]( \"ENGL 0150D\") | Shakespeare's Present Tense |   \n[HIST 0286A]( \"HIST 0286A\") | History of Medicine I: Medical Traditions in the Old World Before 1700 |   \n[ENGL 0310A]( \"ENGL 0310A\") | Shakespeare |   \n[ENGL 0310E]( \"ENGL 0310E\") | Shakespeare: The Screenplays |   \n[HIAA 0550]( \"HIAA 0550\") | Painters, Builders, and Bankers in Early Modern Italy  |   \n[HIAA 0560]( \"HIAA 0560\") | Constructing the Eternal City: Popes and Pilgrims in Early Modern Rome |   \n[HIAA 0630]( \"HIAA 0630\") | Cultural History of the Netherlands in a Golden Age and a Global Age |   \n[COLT 0710I]( \"COLT 0710I\") | New Worlds: Reading Spaces and Places in Colonial Latin America |   \n[FREN 0720A]( \"FREN 0720A\") | De l'Amour courtois au désir postmoderne |   \n[POBS 0910]( \"POBS 0910\") | On the Dawn of Modernity |   \n[ITAL 0981]( \"ITAL 0981\") | When Leaders Lie: Machiavelli in International Context |   \n[FREN 1030A]( \"FREN 1030A\") | L'univers de la Renaissance: XVe et XVIe siècles |   \n[FREN 1030B]( \"FREN 1030B\") | The French Renaissance: The Birth of Modernity? |   \n[FREN 1040B]( \"FREN 1040B\") | Pouvoirs de la scène: le théâtre du XVIIe siècle |   \n[FREN 1040C]( \"FREN 1040C\") | Le Grand Siècle à l'écran |   \n[FREN 1040D]( \"FREN 1040D\") | Molière et son monde |   \n[ENGL 1310A]( \"ENGL 1310A\") | Firing the Canon: Early Modern Women's Writing |   \n[ENGL 1310H]( \"ENGL 1310H\") | The Origins of American Literature |   \n[ENGL 1310J]( \"ENGL 1310J\") | Imagining the Individual in Renaissance England |   \n[ENGL 1310O]( \"ENGL 1310O\") | Restoration and Early Eighteenth-Century Literature |   \n[ENGL 1360K]( \"ENGL 1360K\") | Shakespeare and Company |   \n[ENGL 1360P]( \"ENGL 1360P\") | Shakespearean Tragedy |   \n[ENGL 1360S]( \"ENGL 1360S\") | Between Gods and Beasts: The Renaissance Ovid |   \n[ENGL 1360Z]( \"ENGL 1360Z\") | Shakespeare and Embodiment |   \n[COLT 1410P]( \"COLT 1410P\") | Shakespeare |   \n[HIAA 1560A]( \"HIAA 1560A\") | Italy and the Mediterranean |   \n[ITAL 1580]( \"ITAL 1580\") | Word, Image and Power in Early Modern Italy |   \n[HIAA 1600I]( \"HIAA 1600I\") | Collections and Visual Knowledge in Early Modern Europe: 1400-1800 |   \n[JUDS 1751]( \"JUDS 1751\") | Jews Between Christians and Muslims in the Early Modern World |   \n[HIST 1825H]( \"HIST 1825H\") | Science, Medicine and Technology in the 17th Century |   \n[ENGL 1950A]( \"ENGL 1950A\") | Form and Feeling in Renaissance Poetry |   \n[HIST 1964A]( \"HIST 1964A\") | Age of Impostors: Fraud, Identification, and the Self in Early Modern Europe |   \n[HIST 1974M]( \"HIST 1974M\") | Early Modern Globalization |   \n[EMOW 1980]( \"EMOW 1980\") | Independent Study in EMOW |   \n[LATN 2000A]( \"LATN 2000A\") | Senecan Tragedy |   \n[FREN 2130E]( \"FREN 2130E\") | Corps et esprits libertins |   \n[FREN 2130F]( \"FREN 2130F\") | Façons d'aimer: Discourses of Sexuality in Early Modern France |   \n[HISP 2160G]( \"HISP 2160G\") | Don Quixote: Contexts and Constructions |   \n[ENGL 2360O]( \"ENGL 2360O\") | Irony and Satire |   \n[ENGL 2360P]( \"ENGL 2360P\") | Thinking with Romance in the Renaissance |   \n[ENGL 2360S]( \"ENGL 2360S\") | Alternative Miltons |   \n[HISP 2520I]( \"HISP 2520I\") | Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in Her Literary Context |   \n[ITAL 2550]( \"ITAL 2550\") | Gender Matters |   \n### **Liberal Learning**\nThis concentration develops aesthetic awareness, close reading skills, collaborative skills, cultural understanding, facility with symbolic languages, historical awareness as well as speaking and writing skills.\n### Honors\nInterested and eligible students petition to write a thesis and the faculty chooses the Honors group for that year from the applications, making every effort to accommodate all eligible proposals. Selection is based upon the quality of the application, the preparedness of the student to undertake the project, and the availability of appropriate advisors for the subject. \nStudents accepted in the Honors program sign up for [EMOW 1980]( \"EMOW 1980\") in the Fall and again in the Spring, with the section number of their advisor (REMS 1980 will become [EMOW 1980]( \"EMOW 1980\") as of Fall 2019). Students must meet regularly with their advisors and second readers throughout the year according to a schedule determined by each student and advisor. Finished drafts of the thesis (which will be about 35 pages in length, not counting bibliography and visual or other supporting materials) will be due to the advisor and second reader on April 1 of the Spring semester. Comments will be returned to the students for final polishing and corrections at that point. Students will receive Honors when both their primary advisor and their second reader have provided written statements in support of the finished project. The finished paper, which should be a polished and revised, edited, professional work of original research, will be made available to the entire Early Modern World faculty for comments. There will be a public presentation of the Honors work at the end of the Spring semester.\nStudents planning a December graduation will not be eligible for the Honors Thesis program, but they are welcome to work out other ways to pursue projects of independent interest in consultation with an academic advisor.\nStudents wishing to write an honors thesis must have an A average in the concentration, which means that they will not have received more than one “B” or “S” in any course used for the concentration. Classes taken S/NC may be considered as qualifying the student for Honors if they are marked “S with distinction,” meaning that had the student taken the course for a grade, the grade would have been an “A.” It is advisable for them to have taken at least one class with the person who will advise the thesis, and have already written a research paper before choosing to undertake this year-long writing project. Honors students are strongly encouraged not to take more than 4 classes either semester of their senior year—the Honors class being considered one of the four classes.\n**Honors Application Process**\nApplications are due to the Director of Center for the Study of the Early Modern World in mid-April of the student's junior year. Each application shall consist of:\n1. A very brief (one or two paragraph) cover letter identifying the most appropriate advisor and second readers, and stating also the student’s preparation for the project. Second readers may be professors who work in areas related to the topic, or in some very special cases (and with the advisor’s approval) may be practitioners with whom the student already worked closely, for example.  \n2. A two-page double-spaced abstract stating and explaining the topic (subject and argument) of the research to be undertaken, written as clearly as possible.  \n3. A one-page working bibliography of the most relevant books and major articles to be consulted for the project.  \n4. A current resumé.  \n5. A printout of the most recent transcript.",
  "east": "# East Asian Studies\n\nEast Asian Studies is a multidisciplinary concentration designed for students wishing to attain reasonable fluency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean with specialized exposure to selected East Asian subjects. It serves students with two types of interests: those who aim to pursue active professional careers related to the East Asian region; and those who want to pursue graduate study in the humanities or social sciences with particular emphasis on China, Japan or Korea. Students in East Asian Studies will gain language proficiency and familiarity with East Asia through advanced courses in a variety of disciplines. Concentrators are strongly encouraged, but not required, to study in East Asia for one or two semesters. The concentration requires students to demonstrate a basic proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.\n### The Language Requirement\nThe concentration requires students to demonstrate a basic proficiency in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. For the purposes of the concentration, proficiency is determined to be consistent with successful completion of the Department’s third-year course sequence in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean (0500-0600), or its equivalent. Native speakers of these languages may, for example, demonstrate competency such that language courses may be unnecessary. Department language instructors may also determine that course work completed at one of the language-intensive study abroad programs attended by our undergraduates is comparable to courses offered at Brown. Up to three upper level (700-999) language courses may count as electives for the Focus concentration credit. (Lower-level language courses do not count as concentration electives).\nNote that we do not equate completion of third-year Chinese, Japanese, or Korean with fluency in these languages. Rather, we believe that students who have demonstrated the skills associated with third-year Chinese, Japanese, or Korean have acquired a foundational understanding of the languages’ grammar, vocabularies, and conversational patterns, such that they are able to make themselves understood in everyday situations, and to understand both spoken and written communication.\nFor the purposes of the concentration, language courses through the third-year are treated as an accompanying requirement.\nLanguage Prerequisites (demonstrating proficiency through the third-year or 0600 level in one of the three languages below) |   \n---|---  \nChinese |   \n[CHIN 0100]( \"CHIN 0100\")  \n& [CHIN 0200]( \"CHIN 0200\") | Basic Chinese  \nand Basic Chinese |   \n[CHIN 0300]( \"CHIN 0300\")  \n& [CHIN 0400]( \"CHIN 0400\") | Intermediate Chinese  \nand Intermediate Chinese |   \n[CHIN 0350]( \"CHIN 0350\")  \n& [CHIN 0450]( \"CHIN 0450\") | Elementary to Intermediate Chinese for Advanced Beginners  \nand Advanced Chinese for Heritage Learners |   \n[CHIN 0500]( \"CHIN 0500\")  \n& [CHIN 0600]( \"CHIN 0600\") | Advanced Modern Chinese I  \nand Advanced Modern Chinese I |   \nJapanese |   \n[JAPN 0100]( \"JAPN 0100\")  \n& [JAPN 0200]( \"JAPN 0200\") | Basic Japanese  \nand Basic Japanese |   \n[JAPN 0300]( \"JAPN 0300\")  \n& [JAPN 0400]( \"JAPN 0400\") | Intermediate Japanese  \nand Intermediate Japanese |   \n[JAPN 0500]( \"JAPN 0500\")  \n& [JAPN 0600]( \"JAPN 0600\") | Advanced Japanese I  \nand Advanced Japanese I |   \nKorean |   \n[KREA 0100]( \"KREA 0100\")  \n& [KREA 0200]( \"KREA 0200\") | Korean  \nand Korean |   \n[KREA 0300]( \"KREA 0300\")  \n& [KREA 0400]( \"KREA 0400\") | Intermediate Korean  \nand Intermediate Korean |   \n[KREA 0500]( \"KREA 0500\")  \n& [KREA 0600]( \"KREA 0600\") | Advanced Korean  \nand Advanced Korean |   \n[KREA 0912]( \"KREA 0912\") | Business Korean |   \nLanguage Electives (language courses that may be counted for concentration credit) |   \nChinese |   \n[CHIN 0700]( \"CHIN 0700\")  \n& [CHIN 0800]( \"CHIN 0800\") | Advanced Modern Chinese II  \nand Advanced Modern Chinese II (either course may be taken for one semester) |   \n[CHIN 0911]( \"CHIN 0911\") | Business Chinese |   \n[CHIN 0912]( \"CHIN 0912\") | Chinese Language and Culture |   \n[CHIN 1040]( \"CHIN 1040\") | Modern Chinese Literature |   \nJapanese |   \n[JAPN 0700]( \"JAPN 0700\")  \n& [JAPN 0800]( \"JAPN 0800\") | Advanced Japanese II  \nand Advanced Japanese II (either course may be taken for one semester) |   \n[JAPN 0711]( \"JAPN 0711\") | Japanese Linguistics |   \n[JAPN 0810]( \"JAPN 0810\") | Classical Japanese |   \n[JAPN 0811]( \"JAPN 0811\") | Business Japanese |   \n[JAPN 0812]( \"JAPN 0812\") | Japanese Language and Society through Contemporary Film |   \n[JAPN 1010]( \"JAPN 1010\") | Readings in Contemporary Japanese Fiction |   \n### Electives\nThe concentration requires that students complete a total of eight electives tied to their course of study, which may be defined in linguistic, chronological, thematic, or cultural terms. Students  \nshould choose their courses with the following four requirements in mind.\n  * **Focus Requirement:** In order to ensure intellectual coherence and focus in the concentration, at least three of the eight electives must focus on the geographic region associated with the student’s language study/expertise (including expertise demonstrated in lieu of coursework). For example, a concentrator studying Japanese language, or who has demonstrated competency in Japanese to fulfill the departmental language requirement, should take at least three courses focusing on Japan. Up to three upper level (700-999)  \nlanguage courses may count as electives for the focus concentration credit. (Lower-level language courses do not count as concentration electives).\n  * **EAST Requirement:** At least three of the eight electives must be East Asian Studies (EAST) courses at any level; Chinese (CHIN), Japanese (JAPN), or Korean (KREA) courses at the 1000-level and above may also count toward this requirement.\n  * **Breadth Requirement:** At least one of the eight electives must focus on an East Asian country or culture other than those associated with the language the student is using to satisfy the concentration's language requirement. A concentrator studying Chinese, for example, must choose at least one course that focuses on Korea and/or Japan.\n  * **Senior Seminar Requirement:** At least one of the eight elective courses must be an advanced research seminar, taken in the senior year.\n\nAs is common in multidisciplinary concentrations, a wide range of courses, including many taught by faculty in other departments, may be counted toward the concentration. These include  \ncourses offered by East Asian Studies faculty, faculty with courtesy appointments in the Department, and courses with a significant focus on East Asia offered in such disciplines such as  \nAmerican Studies, Art History, Economics, International Relations, and many others.\nSample Electives offered by East Asian Studies |   \n---|---  \n[EAST 0140]( \"EAST 0140\") | Childhood and Culture in Japan |   \n[EAST 0304]( \"EAST 0304\") | Words on Things: Literature and Material Culture in Early Modern China |   \n[EAST 0307]( \"EAST 0307\") | China Through the Lens: History, Cinema, and Critical Discourse |   \n[EAST 0406]( \"EAST 0406\") | Foreign Bodies in Japan, 600–1600 |   \n[EAST 1505]( \"EAST 1505\") | Two Koreas |   \nFor additional elective choices, visit  |   \n### Senior Seminars\nAt least one of the eight elective courses must be an advanced research seminar, usually taken in the senior year. The research seminar will normally provide students with the opportunity to develop a project or paper focusing on one or more of their areas of inquiry within the concentration. Students are strongly encouraged to find ways to incorporate the use of Chinese-, Japanese-, or Korean-language materials in their research and learning in these courses. Courses falling into this category include EAS seminars over the 1000 level, as well as designated seminars offered by affiliated faculty in such departments as History, Religious Studies, and Comparative Literature, among others. The Department will provide a list of pre-approved senior seminars every semester. Students wishing to add courses to that list must submit their requests in writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies at the start of the semester.\nSample advanced seminars offered by East Asian Studies |   \n---|---  \n[EAST 1931]( \"EAST 1931\") | Market Economy, Popular Culture, and Mass Media in Contemporary China |   \n[EAST 1942]( \"EAST 1942\") | Queer Japan and Beyond |   \n**Double Concentrations**\nStudents who are interested in developing a double concentration, including East Asian Studies as one of the two concentrations, should bear in mind that normally no more than two courses  \nmay be double-counted toward satisfying the course requirements of either of the two concentration programs involved.\n### Study Abroad\nConcentrators are strongly encouraged, though not required, to study in East Asia for one or two semesters during their undergraduate years. Course credits earned abroad are generally transferable to Brown. However, a maximum of three courses taken abroad, of genuine intellectual substance and significantly related to East Asian Studies, may be considered for  \nconcentration credit.\n### Summary of requirements:\n  * Language study through the level of 0600 or the equivalent of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean\n  * Eight elective courses (see details above)\n    * **Focus Requirement:** three courses.\n    * EAST Requirement: three courses. \n    * Breadth Requirement: one course. \n    * Senior Seminar: one course.\n  * ​Honors candidates only: [EAST 1980]( \"EAST 1980\") \n\n**Please note** : _EAS does not currently offer a concentration in Vietnamese. Students who take Vietnamese language in EAS may wish to consider completing a Certificate in Intercultural Competence through the Center for Language Studies._\n### Honors\nEast Asian Studies offers qualified students, in their senior year, the opportunity to undertake a sustained research and writing project that, ideally, will result not merely in a long term paper, but in a piece of original scholarship. To enroll in the Honors Program, the student must be a senior East Asian Studies concentrator, and have earned an A or an S with Distinction in the majority of courses for the concentration. Candidates for Honors are required to have developed a competence in an East Asian language sufficient to allow them to use East Asian language materials in carrying out their research. Students must also successfully obtain the support of at least two faculty members who will agree to serve as primary and secondary advisors for the thesis. Prospective writers submit a thesis prospectus, brief bibliography, and completed application forms (with signatures), ordinarily late in the student’s six semester, to the Director of Undergraduate Studies, who provides the final permission to proceed. Synopses of successful thesis proposals will be distributed to Department faculty.\nThesis writers enroll in advisor-specific sections of the thesis-writing course [EAST 1980]( \"EAST 1980\") (Fall) and [EAST 1981]( \"EAST 1981\") (Spring), meet regularly with their advisors over the course of both semesters,  \nand submit final versions of their theses to the Department in mid-April. Advisors and students are required to provide updates of their progress to the Director of Undergraduate Studies at  \nregular intervals.\nThe completed thesis is evaluated for Honors by the thesis director and by the second reader. In case of a difference of judgment between the two readers, a third opinion may be sought. EAST 1981 counts as one concentration elective credit. The awarding of Honors in East Asian Studies will occur only if the Honors Thesis receives a final grade of A. If an A is not received, the  \nstudent will still receive University academic credit for EAST 1980-81. Students are notified in mid-May whether the Department has recommended the awarding of Honors. Copies of readers’ comments are provided to the student.\nGraduating concentrators may have the ability to present the results of their senior theses in the department’s Senior Project Forum. The Forum will usually take place at the end of the spring semester, but may also occur at the end of the fall semester to accommodate mid-year graduates.",
  "eleg": "# Electrical Engineering\n\nThe Sc.B. program in Electrical Engineering equips students with a solid foundation for careers in electrical engineering and related fields, to advance the knowledge base for future technologies, and to merge teaching, scholarship, and practice in the pursuit of solutions to human needs. Electrical engineers design and manufacture microelectronic hardware; sensors; biomedical instrumentation; communication systems; control systems; radar and navigation equipment, as well as power generation and distribution equipment and propulsion systems. The professional organization for electrical engineers, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), has over 400,000 members worldwide.\n​​The curriculum consists of an interdisciplinary engineering core that includes courses in engineering, mathematics, and computer science, followed by advanced courses in electrical engineering, which include linear systems, analog and digital electronics, advanced science (typically modern physics or quantum mechanics) and three upper-level EE courses selected by the students. The program culminates with the capstone project course.\nThe Electrical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET: < The Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) of the Electrical Engineering Sc.B. Program are to prepare the graduates: (1) to leverage their knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering, and liberal arts to succeed as leaders in engineering and technology industries and in R&D positions in industry and academia; (2) to build broad knowledge and experience in interdisciplinary research and project management, and to apply critical thinking skills in developing and evaluating technological solutions addressing societal needs. The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n**Special Sc.B. Concentrations (non-accredited):**\nIn addition to the standard programs described above, students may also petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue a special engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such special Sc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited. Students with a special concentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specific area of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B. concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study in engineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not covered by one of the existing Sc.B. programs. Accordingly, special concentration programs are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses with breadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree. A total of 21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required. The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2 courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering. At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses, and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, which must be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineering faculty. Note that not all Engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B. requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward the A.B. will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with an engineering faculty advisor, who will submit the petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Petitions must include: (i) a statement of the objectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the courses in the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for any courses in the program that are not part of standard Sc.B. Engineering concentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent study courses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty advisor for this course; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript.\n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. \n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures). In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \nIn rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher-level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n1.

  "dese": "# Design Engineering\n\n[Design Engineering]( (DE) teaches students to understand not just the how and what, but the why and why not behind the creation of technologically enabled products, services and systems. Methodologies, frameworks and analytical tools to evaluate strategic and systemic implications and consequences of these products, services and systems are considered. DE prepares students to (a) effectively apply engineering principles and quantitative analysis to make design decisions, (b) utilize complementary and conflicting principles from domains other than engineering in design decisions, (c) adeptly apply systemic principles to show interactions within and between systems, and (d) achieve fluency in human-centered and systems design processes and principles to analyze and synthesize responses to complex real-world problems.\nVisit \nThe DE program has 19 required courses and a required narrative explaining why the student is choosing Design Engineering, their proposed pathway, and how their courses support that pathway.

  "enph": "# Engineering and Physics\n\nThe program is designed to ensure that students take a significant portion of the usual curriculum in Engineering and Physics, obtain substantial laboratory experience, and take several upper-level elective courses, focusing on applied science. Students may take either the standard Physics or Engineering programs during their first and second years and then switch to this combined program. The Sc.B. degree program in Engineering and Physics is not accredited by ABET and is mostly intended to prepare students for graduate study in applied science and engineering. Since the requirements include both quantum mechanics with the physics concentrators and analog electronics with EE concentrators, as well as more mathematics than either Physics or Engineering, it is one of the more demanding programs at Brown.\nThe following standard program assumes that a student begins mathematics courses at Brown with [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") or [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\"). Students who begin in [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") can substitute an additional science, engineering or higher-level mathematics course for the [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") requirement. To accommodate the diverse preparation of individual students, variations of the following sequences and their prerequisites are possible with permission of the appropriate concentration advisor and the instructors involved.

  "engn": "# Engineering\n\nEngineers make decisions, by collecting and analyzing data; using scientific principles to formulate analytical models of a process; and predicting the outcome of candidate solutions to a problem. They use their creativity to identify innovative solutions to challenging problems. These skills are valuable not only in technical careers, but also in fields such as public service, environmental policy, architecture, teaching, technology management, finance, entrepreneurship or patent law. A foundation in engineering will help prepare you for the future, regardless of your aspirations. The School of Engineering offers the Engineering A.B. degree to enable students to combine a rigorous and interdisciplinary foundation in engineering with the diverse opportunities provided by Brown's liberal arts curriculum. With only 11 required courses, it has the greatest flexibility of all of the School's undergraduate degree programs.\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of  [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1260]( \"MATH 1260\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1610]( \"MATH 1610\") (Probability), or [MATH 1620]( \"MATH 1620\") (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures.) In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n### Standard Program for the A.B. Degree\nPlease note that the A.B. degree program is not accredited by ABET. Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree with a concentration in Engineering must complete at least eight approved Engineering courses. The eight courses must include at least two 1000-level Engineering courses. Of these two 1000-level courses, one must be a design course (ideally capstone or any design course in accredited Sc.B. programs) or be an independent study course that incorporates elements of student project design (must meet Brown course hour requirements), and the other course would be any 1000-level advanced (with pre-requisites) engineering in-classroom experience course. The set of Engineering courses must be chosen with careful attention to the prerequisites of the 1000-level courses.\nNot all engineering courses may be used to satisfy the Engineering course requirement for the A.B. degree. For example, the following courses, in the table below, _cannot be used_ to satisfy the Engineering course requirement for the A.B. Therefore, the program of study must be developed through consultation with the Concentration Advisor.\n[ENGN 0020]( \"ENGN 0020\") | Transforming Society-Technology and Choices for the Future |   \n---|---|---  \n[ENGN 0090]( \"ENGN 0090\") | Management of Industrial and Nonprofit Organizations |   \n[ENGN 0130]( \"ENGN 0130\") | The Engineer's Burden: Why Changing the World is Difficult |   \nENGN 0260 |  Mechanical Technology |   \n[ENGN 0350]( \"ENGN 0350\") | Art Fluid Engineering |   \n[ENGN 0610]( \"ENGN 0610\") | Systems Thinking |   \n[ENGN 0620]( \"ENGN 0620\") | Design Brief |   \n[ENGN 0900]( \"ENGN 0900\") | Managerial Decision Making |   \n[ENGN 0930A]( \"ENGN 0930A\") | Appropriate Technology |   \n[ENGN 0930C]( \"ENGN 0930C\") | DesignStudio |   \n[ENGN 1010]( \"ENGN 1010\") | The Entrepreneurial Process |   \n[ENGN 1800]( \"ENGN 1800\") | Social Impact of Emerging Technologies: The Role of Scientists and Engineers |   \n[ENGN 1931Q]( \"ENGN 1931Q\") | Entrepreneurial Management in Adversity |   \n[ENGN 1931W]( \"ENGN 1931W\") | Selling & Sales Leadership in the Entrepreneurial Environment |   \n[ENGN 1932M]( \"ENGN 1932M\") | Foundations of Internet Communication Systems |   \n[ENGN 2110]( \"ENGN 2110\") | Business Engineering Fundamentals I |   \n[ENGN 2120]( \"ENGN 2120\") | Business Engineering Fundamentals II |   \n[ENGN 2130]( \"ENGN 2130\") | Innovation and Technology Management |   \n[ENGN 2140]( \"ENGN 2140\") | Innovation and Technology Management II |   \n[ENGN 2150]( \"ENGN 2150\") | Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization I |   \n[ENGN 2180]( \"ENGN 2180\") | Globalization Immersion Experience and Entrepreneurship Laboratory |   \n[ENGN 2160]( \"ENGN 2160\") | Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization II |   \nThe A.B. program also requires preparation in Mathematics equivalent to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") and [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\"), as well as at least one college-level science course from the general areas of chemistry (except [CHEM 0100]( \"CHEM 0100\")), biology, physics, or geological sciences.

  "ecb": "# Earth, Climate, and Biology\n\nStudents in Earth, Climate and Biology apply principles from Earth science, biology, chemistry, and physics to understand how major components of the Earth system, such as its atmosphere and oceans, interact with and sustain life over time. Many courses emphasize climate change, environmental quality, and biogeochemistry, so this concentration is a good match for students interested in studying the environment. Courses also investigate Earth history, including past climate, extinction events, and using the Earth’s sedimentary record to investigate environmental change.\nBoth A.B. and Sc.B. degrees are offered, requiring 12 and 19 courses, respectively. These degrees build skills in critical thinking, data analysis and modeling, finding solutions to complex problems, and written and oral communication. DEEPS provides a highly collaborative learning environment that emphasizes process-oriented, hands-on approaches in the classroom, in labs and on field trips. There are many opportunities for students to do paid research during the summer or academic year.\nStudents interested in this concentration may also wish to consider related concentrations: Geochemistry and Environmental Chemistry, Geophysics and Climate Physics, and Earth and Planetary Science.\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree\nThis program provides a broad introduction to the geologic and biologic processes that shape the Earth and our environment. It is recommended for students seeking to combine diverse educational interests with a general understanding of Earth processes, including the evolution of climate and the environment, global environmental change and Earth history. The program prepares students for careers in environmental science, geoscience, ecology, oceanography, and global change. Some course requirements may be flexible based on consultation with the concentration advisor.\n**_Note - For students still enrolled with the prior Concentration in Geology-Biology A.B., please refer to the Archived Bulletin link on left hand navigation for your requirements for the year you declared._**\nBasic supporting science courses |   \n---|---  \n[BIOL 0200]( \"BIOL 0200\") | The Foundation of Living Systems (or equivalent) | 1  \nor [BIOL 0210]( \"BIOL 0210\") |  Diversity of Life  \n[CHEM 0330]( \"CHEM 0330\") | Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure (or equivalent) | 1  \nA course to build quantitative skills:  | 1  \n[MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") | Single Variable Calculus, Part I (or higher) |   \n[BIOL 0495]( \"BIOL 0495\") | Statistical Analysis of Biological Data |   \nor [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Calculus  \n[CSCI 0111]( \"CSCI 0111\") | Computing Foundations: Data (or higher) |   \n[ENGN 0040]( \"ENGN 0040\") | Engineering Statics and Dynamics (or higher) |   \n[PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\") | Foundations of Mechanics (or higher) |   \n[APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") | Applied Ordinary Differential Equations (or higher) |   \nNine Concentration courses  |   \nTwo of these four fundamentals courses: | 2  \n[EEPS 0220]( \"EEPS 0220\") | Understanding Earth and Environmental Processes |   \n[EEPS 0230]( \"EEPS 0230\") | Geochemistry: Earth and Planetary Materials and Processes |   \n[EEPS 0240]( \"EEPS 0240\") | Earth: Evolution of a Habitable Planet |   \n[EEPS 0250]( \"EEPS 0250\") | Computational Approaches to Modelling and Quantitative Analysis in Natural Sciences: An Introduction |   \n[EEPS 1240]( \"EEPS 1240\") | Stratigraphy and Sedimentation | 1  \nSelect three upper level Biology courses such as:  | 3  \n[BIOL 0410]( \"BIOL 0410\") | Invertebrate Zoology |   \n[BIOL 0420]( \"BIOL 0420\") | Principles of Ecology |   \n[BIOL 0430]( \"BIOL 0430\") | The Evolution of Plant Diversity |   \n[BIOL 0480]( \"BIOL 0480\") | Evolutionary Biology |   \n[BIOL 1470]( \"BIOL 1470\") | Conservation Biology |   \nThree EEPS courses such as:  | 3  \nOne of [EEPS 0220]( \"EEPS 0220\"), [EEPS 0230]( \"EEPS 0230\"), [EEPS 0240]( \"EEPS 0240\"), or [EEPS 0250]( \"EEPS 0250\") if not already taken |   \n[EEPS 0850]( \"EEPS 0850\") | Weather and Climate |   \n[EEPS 1120]( \"EEPS 1120\") | Paleoceanography |   \n[EEPS 1130]( \"EEPS 1130\") | Ocean Biogeochemical Cycles |   \n[EEPS 1150]( \"EEPS 1150\") | Limnology: The Study of Lakes |   \n[EEPS 1310]( \"EEPS 1310\") | Global Water Cycle |   \n[EEPS 1320]( \"EEPS 1320\") | Introduction to Geographic Information Systems for Environmental Applications |   \n[EEPS 1370]( \"EEPS 1370\") | Environmental Geochemistry |   \n[EEPS 1615]( \"EEPS 1615\") | Climate Change, Human Rights, and the Policy Process |   \n[EEPS 1970]( \"EEPS 1970\") | Individual Study of Geologic Problems |   \nTotal Credits | 12  \n### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nThis program is recommended for students interested in more in-depth study in the Earth, environmental, or biological sciences, potentially including graduate school and diverse careers in these areas.

  "colt": "# Comparative Literature\n\nThe concentration in Comparative Literature enables students to study an illustrative range of literary topics and to develop a focused critical understanding of how cultures differ from one another and what those differences mean. Our courses provide opportunities to engage with literary works across linguistic and cultural boundaries, exploring the traditions and innovations of the literatures of the world.\nIn the spirit of Brown’s Open Curriculum, a concentration in Comparative Literature affords great academic freedom. Advanced literature courses from any literature department at Brown count for concentration credit. Any language —ancient or modern—supported at Brown may form part of a Comparative Literature concentration program. All students take a course in literary theory and have the opportunity to complete a senior essay.\nThere are three concentration tracks and requirements:\n  * Track 1: Comparative Literature in Two Languages\n  * Track 2: Comparative Literature in Three Languages\n  * Track 3: Literary Translation\n\nGenre and Period Requirements for all concentrators:\n  * One course in each literary genre (poetry, narrative, and drama/film)\n  * Courses must cover at least three different historical periods (such as, Antiquity; Middle Ages; Renaissance/Early Modern; Enlightenment; Modern: 19th-21st centuries).\n\n### **Prerequisites in languages:**\nStudents must demonstrate proficiency in the languages of their selected literatures. We recommend that prerequisite(s) for taking 1000-level courses in their languages be completed by Semester V.\nStudents working in non-European languages may be allowed more latitude; be sure to be sure to consult a concentration advisor about constructing an individualized plan.\n### Selecting literature courses in your language areas:\nReadings must normally be in the original language. If English is one of your languages, courses need to be devoted chiefly to literature originally written in English.\n### **Transfer of Credits:**\nTwo courses per semester of study abroad may be applied to the concentration, up to a total of four courses (for two semesters abroad). A maximum of five courses from external venues (study abroad; transfer credits from other institutions, including summer study) may be applied to the concentration.\n### **Joint or Double Concentration:**\nJoint or double concentration programs may also be arranged. Students may also combine a concentration in Comparative Literature with a teaching certificate in English or a modern language. A student interested in such a program should consult the advisor in the [Education Department]( and the advisor in Comparative Literature as early as possible (preferably by Semester V). In accordance with University policy, double concentrators are allowed a maximum overlap of two courses between concentrations.\n### Track 1: Concentration in Comparative Literature in two languages\n### Requirements\n[COLT 1210]( \"COLT 1210\") | Introduction to the Theory of Literature | 1  \n---|---|---  \nTWO literature courses taught above the 1000-level in the first chosen literature.

Literature**\nStudents in all tracks may earn honors in the concentration by successfully completing a thesis that is granted honors upon submission. Completing a thesis in any track does not guarantee departmental honors. Honors are granted upon the recommendation of the two thesis readers.\n**Tracks 1 & 2.** Theses are analytical studies of literary topics, comparative in nature, based upon research, and usually between 50 and 100 pages. They are usually composed of 3 chapters, with an introduction and a conclusion. Students are expected to choose a topic that involves work in each of the literatures of their concentration in the original language. \n**Track 3**. Theses consist of a substantial work in translation with a critical introduction outlining the method used and specific problems encountered, and commenting on the history of the original work together with other translations, if any.\n(See detailed [Guidelines for Honors Theses]( in Comparative Literature on Departmental website).\n### **Capstone option**\nStudents in Tracks 1 & 2 not taking Honors are urged, but not required, to complete a senior essay, which may be less extensive in scope and length than the Honors thesis but which should constitute an integration of some aspect of their study.",
  "egya": "# Egyptology and Assyriology\n\nThe concentration in Egyptology and Assyriology offers students a choice of two tracks: Assyriology or Egyptology. The department promotes collaborations with other academic units at Brown devoted to the study of antiquity including Archaeology, Classics, Judaic Studies, and Religious Studies. Egyptology and Assyriology also collaborates with Brown's Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.\n### Assyriology Track\nAlso known as the Near East or Middle East, Western Asia includes present-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and other neighboring states, a broad geographic area that was connected in antiquity with the wider world—the Mediterranean, North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, and the Asian subcontinent. Students will be exposed to the critical study of the ancient cultures of this region (ca. 3400 B.C.E.–100 C.E.) using the tools of archaeology, epigraphy, and historical inquiry. A variety of interdisciplinary, comparative, and theoretical approaches will be introduced to give students the tools and methods to explore this region’s ancient languages and literatures, political and socio-economic modes of organization, art and architecture, religious traditions and other systems of knowledge, such as early science.\nThe Assyriology (ASYR) track requires a total of at least ten (10) courses that are determined in the following way:\nLanguage Courses (two courses) | 2  \n---|---  \nOne course in cuneiform-based language, normally Introduction to Akkadian, Introduction to Sumerian, or Introduction to Hittite.

Under normal circumstances a concentrator will complete a capstone project in their last undergraduate year, the idea being that the project will be a culmination of the student’s academic path at Brown and in the department. Students have three options for fulfilling the capstone requirement in Egyptology and Assyriology:\n  1. Honors Thesis (see policies and procedures for Honors in Egyptology and Assyriology)\n  2. Independent Study: A one-semester reading and research independent study course under the direction of a faculty advisor in the department (this course may count toward the concentration Depth or Breadth requirement subject to the approval of the concentration advisor and DUS). The independent study should result in a research paper (at least 5000 words) or a significant original translation and analysis of an ancient text or a coherent group of related texts. \n  3. Course Project: a project undertaken in connection with an EGYT/ASYR/ARCH course at or above the 1000 level (this course may count toward the concentration Depth or Breadth requirement). The specific project should be discussed with, and must be approved by, the instructor of the relevant course and the DUS\n\nThe capstone project can take many forms, but the common feature shared among all possible projects will be a public presentation. Typically in the final semester before graduating, the concentrator will give this capstone presentation before the department community. The format of the presentation may vary: students may give an illustrated lecture, present and discuss a video or installation, or propose a novel presentation modality. Both the content and the format of the capstone project must be discussed beforehand and approved by the concentration advisor and DUS no later than the end of the first semester of the senior year. \n### Honors in Egyptology and Assyriology\n_1. Becoming an honors candidate_  \nStudents who wish to consider pursuing honors should meet with the Undergraduate Concentration Advisor in the first half of their sixth semester.  \nEligibility is dependent on:\n  * Being in good standing\n  * Having completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirements by the end of the sixth semester.\n  * Having earned two-thirds \"quality grades\" in courses counted towards the concentration. A \"quality grade\" is defined as a grade of \"A\" or a grade of \"S\" accompanied by a course performance report indicating a performance at the \"A\" standard.\n\nTo pursue honors candidacy, eligible students must:\n  * Secure a faculty advisor and discuss plans for the proposed thesis project well before the established deadline; this can be done by email when a student is abroad.\n  * Prepare a thesis prospectus (see below).\n  * Submit the prospectus to the advisor, one other proposed faculty reader (at least one of the readers must be in the department) and the department chair _no later than the first week of the seventh semester._\n\nThe structure of a thesis prospectus:  \nAn honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is a substantial piece of research with some degree of originality that demonstrates the student's ability to frame an appropriate question and deal critically with the range of original and secondary sources. A thesis prospectus is a short analytical document consisting of several parts. It will normally include a concise and focused research question; a justification for that question that demonstrates familiarity with previous research on the topic; a project description that includes a discussion of the types of evidence available and appropriate to answering the proposed question; a discussion of methods of collecting and analyzing that evidence; a conclusion that returns to the research question and assures the reader that the project will add value to our understanding of the topic; and a bibliography. The prospectus will ordinarily be in the range of 5-7 pages in length, exclusive of bibliography. The prospectus will include proper citations throughout.\nDetermination of whether or not a student may pursue the proposed project will be made on review of the prospectus by the readers and department chair. Prospectuses will be evaluated on the following scale:\n  1. No concerns about the viability of the project.\n  2. No concerns about the viability of the project, but minor weaknesses in the execution of the prospectus. \n  3. Concerns about the viability of the project, but willingness to reevaluate a revised prospectus submitted within two weeks of receipt of evaluation.\n  4. Reservations that the prospectus does not describe an honors-worthy project.\n  5. Poorly conceived and shoddy work. \n\nProspectuses will be returned to the student with this numerical evaluation and comments one week after submission of the prospectus. A prospectus must receive an evaluation of 1 or 2 prior to the third week of the seventh semester for a student to be admitted to the honors track. Students who submit an original prospectus that is graded 4 or 5 will not be permitted to rework the prospectus for the second submission. \n_2. Developing, completing and submitting the honors project_\nOnce accepted as honors candidates, students will pursue a course of study that goes beyond what is expected of a regular concentrator. This includes:\n  * Enrollment in two semesters of independent study in Egyptology or Assyriology (these do not fulfill course requirements towards the concentration).\n  * Twice-monthly meetings with the thesis advisor and once-monthly meetings with the second reader. These meetings will be scheduled at the beginning of each term.\n  * Submission of a comprehensive outline to both readers no later than October 15 (for May graduates)\n  * Regular submission of drafts. A partial draft including a complete version of at least one chapter or section is due before Reading Period of the seventh semester.\n  * A complete draft is due to both readers no later than March 15 (for May graduates).\n  * The revised final thesis is due in both electronic and physical form to both readers and department chair April 5 (for May graduates).\n\nFailure to meet any deadline will result in automatic termination of the honors process. No extensions will be granted. If a thesis is turned in late but before the end of the term, credit and grade for the Independent Study may still be granted.\n_3. Evaluating the submitted work of honors candidates_\nIn order to receive honors a student must be found to have:\n  * Remained in good academic standing throughout the academic year.\n  * Not violated the Academic Code of Conduct during honors candidacy.\n  * Complete or be about to complete all concentration requirements.\n  * Produced a thesis that is judged by the readers to meet the department's expectations for honors work (see below), and turned it in by the established deadlines.\n  * Successfully defended the thesis during a half hour public presentation held during the final exam period of the eighth semester.\n\nStudents who submit theses that are deemed to fall short of the expectations will graduate without honors. In that case, the theses will count as a capstone project.\n_4. Expectations for honors theses:_\nOriginality:  \nAn honors thesis in Egyptology or Assyriology is expected to add to existing scholarship. The thesis must be based on close work with primary sources (usually in publication rather than in person), supplemented by critical engagement with a substantial amount of relevant secondary literature. While the resulting study is not necessarily expected to be ground-breakingly original, and may engage with a well-studied topic, it will usually include a new insight into or interpretation of the material considered.\nScope:  \nAn honors thesis is not a book or dissertation. It is, however, a very serious piece of research and writing for which two dedicated study courses have provided substantial time to the honors student. The question upon which the honors thesis is based should be focused enough to allow an in-depth treatment, generally in under 100 pages or 30,000 words (exclusive of bibliography and illustrations). Appropriate length will vary considerably depending on the topic itself and the nature of the primary sources being considered, particularly if substantial translation of ancient textual sources is required.\nArgument:  \nThe thesis should present a sustained analytic argument in answer to its structuring question. A thesis should not be primarily descriptive or narrative in nature. Each chapter should contain a sub-argument that is clearly related to the overall argument of the thesis. The significance of the argument and its relationship to prior scholarship should be clearly articulated. Honors theses are not expected to demonstrate comprehensive familiarity with the secondary literature, but they are expected to engage critically and maturely with important works on the defined topic.\nMethodology:  \nEgyptology and Assyriology are very broad fields, and the appropriate methods will be determined in conjunction with the thesis advisor on the basis of the questions and types of evidence - textual, archaeological, art historical - under consideration. With very few exceptions the methodology of the thesis is expected to be conventional rather than innovative, rooted in the accepted practices of the field in question.\nOrganization and writing:  \nAn honors thesis must be well organized and written. It should include an introduction and conclusion as well as well-considered chapters that allow the reader to follow the line of reasoning easily. The relationship of any section to the larger whole should be clear, and segues should help the reader move between sections. Writing should be grammatically correct, well copy-edited, professional, and consistent. Citations and bibliography must be in an accepted style as determined in consultation with the advisor.",
  "eths": "# Ethnic Studies\n\nEthnic Studies is an interdisciplinary, comparative concentration that examines the construction of race and ethnicity in social, cultural, historical, political, and economic contexts. Concentrators develop individual programs based on areas of focus in consultation with faculty advisors, drawing from courses in the humanities and social sciences. Typical areas of focus are social issues (such as inequality, education, or health), cultural production and the representation of racial groups, processes of racialization, the historical formation of transnational communities and of diaspora, and the history of particular ethnic or racial groups.\nThe Ethnic Studies concentration emphasizes the histories of diverse racial groups within and across the borders of the United States, including examining issues of diaspora, migration, social movements, and the political economies of social inequality and racial formation. Concentrators strive for intellectual fluency in a range of critical approaches to race and ethnicity across disciplines, and demonstrate this fluency through the composition or creation of a significant piece of original research or creative work.\n### Requirements\nIn consultation with the Concentration Advisor, each concentrator develops an individualized program of study of **10 courses** (or 12 courses for those completing an Honors Thesis). Five of these courses must be linked to an individual focus area formulated by the student.\n**Required courses:**\n  * **[ETHN 1000]( \"ETHN 1000\") “Introduction to Ethnic Studies”**\n  * **Any three courses from the ETHN 1200 “Topics in Ethnic Studies” or ETHN 1750 “Advanced Topics in Ethnic Studies” sequence** , or similar 1000-level electives listed under AMST (with approval from the concentration advisor).\n  * **Five additional courses** that address the student’s **focus area** and prepare them for the capstone experience. These may be listed in AMST or ETHN, or in another department if linked to the student's focus area. (Outside courses require concentration advisor approval; a maximum of 3 courses outside of AMST/ETHN can count toward the concentration). \n    * **Up to two** ETHN or AMST courses below the 1000-level may count toward the focus area (for instance, a first-year seminar and a sophomore seminar).\n    * **Up to one** of the focus area courses may be a **Department Independent Study Project (DISP)** , undertaken with an American Studies/Ethnic Studies faculty member and offered under an ETHN course number.\n    * If you intend to pursue honors, one of the focus area courses should be the **AMST 1800 Honors Seminar** (taken during the junior year).\n  * **ETHN 1900 \"Senior Seminar in Ethnic Studies** \". In this spring semester course, senior concentrators collectively reflect on their experience in the concentration and the current state of the field, while also designing/completing a senior capstone project (or completing the honors thesis, if pursuing honors).\n  * **Honors Thesis****(optional):** Concentrators hoping to pursue honors should take the joint AMST/ETHN **Honors Seminar,[AMST 1800]( \"AMST 1800\"), in the spring of their junior year** . Students pursuing honors are also required to take **two independent study courses ([ETHN 1920]( \"ETHN 1920\"))** in their senior year in order to complete the honors thesis. These independent study courses raise the total number of required concentration courses to 12.\n\n### Honors:\nStudents who hope to pursue Honors are encouraged to take [AMST 1800]( \"AMST 1800\"), the Honors Seminar, in the Spring of their Junior year, in preparation for submitting an Honors thesis proposal. Admission to Honors candidacy requires an academic record providing evidence of the student's ability to do Honors work. At least half of the student's grades in courses counted toward the concentration must be grades of A or \"S with Distinction\", and Honors proposals must include a recommendation form completed by a faculty member who has taught a class requiring a significant research paper. Students pursuing Honors are required to take two independent study courses in their senior year, in addition to the regular concentration requirements (for a total of 12 credits), in order to write their Honors thesis. Guidelines for completion and submission of the thesis are on the department website.",
  "ctmp": "# Contemplative Studies\n\nThe concentration in Contemplative Studies investigates the underlying philosophical, psychological, and scientific bases of human contemplative experience. Students pursue a \"third person\" academic approach drawn from the humanities and sciences to analyze the cultural, historical, and scientific underpinnings of contemplative experiences in religion, art, music, and literature. This is developed in combination with a \"critical first-person\" approach based in practical experience of contemplative techniques and methods to provide an integrated understanding of the role of contemplative thought and experience in societies and on the individuals who constitute them.\n### Concentration Core (6 courses including the Senior Concentration Seminar)\n[COST 0100]( \"COST 0100\") | Introduction to Contemplative Studies | 1  \n---|---|---  \nTwo introductory science courses addressing the biological, psychological, and neurological functionsing of the human body/mind complex with health implications, and how contemplative practices affect it.  |   \nSelect one from the following list: | 1  \n[BIOL 0200]( \"BIOL 0200\") | The Foundation of Living Systems |   \n[CPSY 0200]( \"CPSY 0200\") | Human Cognition |   \n[CPSY 0500]( \"CPSY 0500\") | Perception and Mind |   \n[NEUR 0010]( \"NEUR 0010\") | The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience |   \nOthers with approval |   \nSelect one from following list: | 1  \n[COST 0200]( \"COST 0200\") | Meditation and the Brain |   \n[COST 1020]( \"COST 1020\") | Cognitive Neuroscience of Meditation |   \nTwo humanities courses that present important themes that can emerge from bringing a Contemplative Studies perspective to the study of contemplative religious traditions and to the philosophical analysis of the key questions of human existence.  | 2  \n[ANTH 1240]( \"ANTH 1240\") | Religion and Culture |   \n[CLAS 0990]( \"CLAS 0990\") | Karma and Free Will: The Self in Indian Philosophy |   \n[CLAS 1120G]( \"CLAS 1120G\") | The Idea of Self |   \n[COST 0040]( \"COST 0040\") | Great Contemplative Traditions of Asia |   \nor [RELS 0040]( \"RELS 0040\") |  Great Contemplative Traditions of Asia  \n[COST 0145]( \"COST 0145\") | Karma, Rebirth and Liberation: Life and Death in South Asian Religions |   \nor [RELS 0145]( \"RELS 0145\") |  Karma, Rebirth and Liberation: Life and Death in South Asian Religions  \n[COST 0450]( \"COST 0450\") | Stages of the Contemplative Path |   \n[PHIL 0010]( \"PHIL 0010\") | The Place of Persons |   \n[PHIL 0015]( \"PHIL 0015\") | Introduction to Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 0510]( \"PHIL 0510\") | Psychology and Philosophy of Happiness |   \n[PHIL 1800]( \"PHIL 1800\") | Philosophy of Mind |   \n[PHIL 1825]( \"PHIL 1825\") | Consciousness |   \n[RELS 0056]( \"RELS 0056\") | Spiritual But Not Religious: Making Spirituality in America |   \n[RELS 0065]( \"RELS 0065\") | On Being Human: Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Self |   \n[RELS 1370B]( \"RELS 1370B\") | Philosophy of Mysticism |   \nOthers with approval |   \n[COST 1950]( \"COST 1950\") | Senior Concentrators' Seminar | 1  \nStudents must complete six addtional courses in either a Science or Humanities track. | 6  \nTotal Credits | 12  \n### Track Requirements (6 additional courses Including a Capstone Course)\nStudents must complete either a Science or Humanities track in addition to the concentration core.\n### Science Track\nThe Science track in Contemplative Studies gives concentrators a foundational understanding of the scientific methods used to investigate the biological, psychological, and neurological effects of contemplative practice and their potential implications on physical and mental health both for individuals and for the general public. Students will be taught how to critique current research as well as how to develop, operationalize, and test hypotheses related to contemplative practice. Students will become well-versed in how to study first-person reports related to the _phenomenology_ of contemplative experience as a foundation for formulating third-person tests of the effects of practice on brain function and behavior. The Contemplative Studies Science Track trains students to investigate these types of questions not only for academic scholarship, but also to provide a method of self-inquiry that can be used to augment any area of life. \nFive thematic science courses, including a Capstone Course, drawn primarily from BIOL,COST, NEUR, CLPS, and PHP, at least one of which must include laboratory work and two of which must be 1000-level; and one Statistics course for a total of six courses.  | 5  \n---|---  \nThe Capstone Course is intended to be a culmination of the students' concentration in which they will bring to bear what their interests have been in developing their focused work in the program.

To apply, students submit a proposal for a senior thesis project describing the work to be undertaken and its relevance to the field of Contemplative Studies, along with a copy of their academic transcript. Students accepted into Honors must complete the required Capstone seminar, UNIV 1010, and enroll in an additional semester of independent study in their advisor’s department. Students must complete an Honors Thesis to the satisfaction of their advisor and present the results of their studies in formal talks or poster sessions open to all interested faculty and students.",
  "csec": "# Computer Science-Economics\n\nThe joint Computer Science-Economics concentration exposes students to the theoretical and practical connections between computer science and economics. It prepares students for professional careers that incorporate aspects of economics and computer technology and for academic careers conducting research in areas that emphasize the overlap between the two fields. Concentrators may choose to pursue either the A.B. or the Sc.B. degree. While the A.B. degree allows students to explore the two disciplines by taking advanced courses in both departments, its smaller number of required courses is compatible with a liberal education. The Sc.B. degree achieves greater depth in both computer science and economics by requiring more courses, and it offers students the opportunity to creatively integrate both disciplines through a design requirement. If you are interested in declaring a concentration in Computer Science-Economics, please refer to this page for more information regarding the process.

  "engl": "# English\n\nThe English Department fosters the study of British, American, and Anglophone literature—old and new—in ways that are both intensive and open. We study how English literature works, how we understand and appreciate it, and how we write about it. We offer a wide array of courses in poetry, drama, fiction, creative nonfiction, film, digital media, and theory. All our courses emphasize the development of student skills in writing, textual analysis, and argument. The department’s faculty members are deeply committed to undergraduate teaching and advising. You will find considerable diversity in our critical methods, including cross-disciplinary approaches that relate the study of literature to history, politics, science, as well as to other art forms. We encourage students in our classes likewise to forge their own new ways of understanding literature and culture.\nIn addition to the standard English concentration, we offer an English concentration track in the practice of Nonfiction Writing. The concentration in English and the English/Nonfiction track follow the same core requirements, and students in the English concentration may elect Nonfiction Writing courses as electives. We invite applications from qualified juniors to the honors programs in both English and Nonfiction.\nOne of the largest humanities concentrations at Brown, English provides a strong foundation for a liberal education and for employment in many sectors, especially those that centrally involve writing and working with texts (in any form). In addition to authorship, scholarship, and teaching, these include: journalism, publishing, advertising, visual media, consulting, public relations, public service, finance, government, corporate research, and administration. Our English concentrators routinely go on to law, medical, and professional schools as well as to graduate education in literature and the arts.\n### About the Concentration\nWe encourage students interested in concentrating in English to visit the department offices at 70 Brown Street and speak with a [concentration advisor]( Students in English courses who are considering an English concentration are welcome to make an appointment to speak with their instructor. Concentration programs must be approved by a concentration advisor.\n### Concentration Requirements\n### (10 courses1):\n1. ONE course in \"How Literature Matters\" (ENGL0100, 0101): | 1  \n---|---  \nAddressing topics about which professors are especially passionate, these introductory courses aim to deepen and refine students’ understanding of how literature matters: aesthetically, ethically, historically and politically. Students not only engage with larger questions about literature’s significance, exploring the particular kinds of insights and thinking it is especially suited for conveying, they also gain a deeper awareness of the critical methods we use to understand and analyze it, engaging with matters of form, genre and media. Finally, these courses help students develop their skills as close, careful readers of literary form and language. |   \n[ENGL 0100A]( \"ENGL 0100A\") | How To Read A Poem |   \n[ENGL 0100C]( \"ENGL 0100C\") | Altered States |   \n[ENGL 0100D]( \"ENGL 0100D\") | Matters of Romance |   \n[ENGL 0100F]( \"ENGL 0100F\") | Devils, Demons, Do-Gooders |   \n[ENGL 0100G]( \"ENGL 0100G\") | The Literature of Identity |   \n[ENGL 0100J]( \"ENGL 0100J\") | Cultures and Countercultures: The American Novel after World War II |   \n[ENGL 0100M]( \"ENGL 0100M\") | Writing War |   \n[ENGL 0100N]( \"ENGL 0100N\") | City Novels |   \n[ENGL 0100P]( \"ENGL 0100P\") | Love Stories |   \n[ENGL 0100Q]( \"ENGL 0100Q\") | How Poems See |   \n[ENGL 0100R]( \"ENGL 0100R\") | American Histories, American Novels |   \n[ENGL 0100S]( \"ENGL 0100S\") | Being Romantic |   \n[ENGL 0100T]( \"ENGL 0100T\") | The Simple Art of Murder |   \n[ENGL 0100U]( \"ENGL 0100U\") | Serial Fictions |   \n[ENGL 0100V]( \"ENGL 0100V\") | Inventing Asian American Literature |   \n[ENGL 0100W]( \"ENGL 0100W\") | Literature Reformatted |   \n[ENGL 0100Y]( \"ENGL 0100Y\") | Do the Right Thing |   \n[ENGL 0101A]( \"ENGL 0101A\") | Independence and Modern Literature |   \n[ENGL 0101B]( \"ENGL 0101B\") | Earth Poetics: Literature and Climate Change |   \n2. ONE course in Medieval and Renaissance Literatures (Pre-1700): | 1  \nThese courses, which center on Medieval and Renaissance literary works, cast light on periods that can come across to us as both familiar and strange. They focus our attention on how literatures from these periods depict concepts such as aesthetics, romance, gender, sexuality, race, power and politics in ways that are like and unlike how we tend to think of them today—on how pre-modern or early modern works can both defamiliarize the categories of experience and identity we tend to take for granted and also suggest something of their origins. Several courses under this rubric will also engage with recent literary and filmic adaptations of works from these eras, exploring how many such works continue to function as vibrant and at times ambivalent inspirations for the literary imaginings of later periods. |   \n3. ONE course in Literatures of Modernity (Post-1700): | 1  \nThese courses explore the many strands of writing in English that have emerged from the eighteenth century through the present, shaping the contemporary world. These literatures reflect on political, economic, and intellectual history, from the idea of the nation and the structures of capital through the rise and dissolution of empire and the emergence of postcolonial states, including the forms of race, gender and sexuality that cut across them. Courses also examine how aesthetic works can shape and critique their moment: they look at genres like the novel and short story, poetry, drama, essays, and new, hybrid forms that have arisen with expanding digital media; they also take up a multitude of literary movements whose influences remain with us today, including Romanticism, realism, naturalism, modernism, and post-modernism. |   \n4. ONE course in Literatures of the Color Line: | 1  \nIn 1903, W. E. B. Du Bois famously proclaimed in \"The Souls of Black Folk\" that “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,—the relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea.” Courses in this category explore the complex ways in which literary texts have addressed American histories of race, ethnicity, and empire. They may do so from the vantage point of ideas about difference and hierarchy that predate the modern conception of race and by engaging with earlier histories of conflict and contact. These courses explore issues of intersectionality as well, highlighting how race operates in relation to other structures of difference such as gender, sexuality and class. |   \n[ENGL 0100F]( \"ENGL 0100F\") | Devils, Demons, Do-Gooders |   \n[ENGL 0100N]( \"ENGL 0100N\") | City Novels |   \n[ENGL 0100S]( \"ENGL 0100S\") | Being Romantic |   \n[ENGL 0100V]( \"ENGL 0100V\") | Inventing Asian American Literature |   \n[ENGL 0101A]( \"ENGL 0101A\") | Independence and Modern Literature |   \n[ENGL 0150X]( \"ENGL 0150X\") | The Claims of Fiction |   \n[ENGL 0150Y]( \"ENGL 0150Y\") | Brontës and Brontëism |   \n[ENGL 0700E]( \"ENGL 0700E\") | Postcolonial Literature |   \n[ENGL 0500R]( \"ENGL 0500R\") | Slavery and American Literature |   \n[ENGL 0510F]( \"ENGL 0510F\") | Literature of the American Renaissance |   \n[ENGL 0700G]( \"ENGL 0700G\") | American Fiction and Mass Culture |   \n[ENGL 0700U]( \"ENGL 0700U\") | Modernism and Race |   \n[ENGL 0710B]( \"ENGL 0710B\") | African American Literature and the Legacies of Slavery |   \n[ENGL 0710Q]( \"ENGL 0710Q\") | American Literature in the Era of Segregation |   \n[ENGL 0710V]( \"ENGL 0710V\") | Death and Dying in Black Literature |   \n[ENGL 0710W]( \"ENGL 0710W\") | Readings in Black and Queer |   \n[ENGL 0710X]( \"ENGL 0710X\") | Black Poetics |   \n[ENGL 0710Y]( \"ENGL 0710Y\") | Literature of US Inequality, 1945-2020 |   \n[ENGL 1310H]( \"ENGL 1310H\") | The Origins of American Literature |   \n[ENGL 1511A]( \"ENGL 1511A\") | American Literature and the Civil War |   \n[ENGL 1511C]( \"ENGL 1511C\") | Lincoln, Whitman, and The Civil War |   \n[ENGL 1511P]( \"ENGL 1511P\") | Realism, Modernism, Postmodernism: The American Novel and its Traditions |   \n[ENGL 1710I]( \"ENGL 1710I\") | Harlem Renaissance: The Politics of Culture |   \n[ENGL 1710J]( \"ENGL 1710J\") | Modern African Literature  |   \n[ENGL 1710K]( \"ENGL 1710K\") | Literature and the Problem of Poverty |   \n[ENGL 1710M]( \"ENGL 1710M\") | Nationalizing Narratives: Race, Nationalism, and the American Novel |   \n[ENGL 1710P]( \"ENGL 1710P\") | The Literature and Culture of Black Power Reconsidered |   \n[ENGL 1711D]( \"ENGL 1711D\") | Reading New York |   \n[ENGL 1711H]( \"ENGL 1711H\") | Lyric Concepts: The Question of Identity in Modern and Contemporary Poetry |   \n[ENGL 1711J]( \"ENGL 1711J\") | Art for an Undivided Earth / Transnational Approaches to Indigenous Art and Activism |   \n[ENGL 1711K]( \"ENGL 1711K\") | The Politics of Perspective: Post-war British Fiction |   \n[ENGL 1711L]( \"ENGL 1711L\") | Contemporary Black Women's Literature |   \n[ENGL 1711N]( \"ENGL 1711N\") | Monsters in our Midst: The Plantation and the Woods in Trans-American Literature |   \n[ENGL 1711O]( \"ENGL 1711O\") | Radical Pasts, Radical Futures: Literature and the Left |   \n[ENGL 1711S]( \"ENGL 1711S\") | James Baldwin |   \n[ENGL 1760U]( \"ENGL 1760U\") | American Modernism and its Aftermaths |   \n[ENGL 1760Y]( \"ENGL 1760Y\") | Toni Morrison |   \n[ENGL 1761B]( \"ENGL 1761B\") | Narratives of Blackness in Latinx and Latin America |   \n[ENGL 1761E]( \"ENGL 1761E\") | Blackness and Being |   \n[ENGL 1761F]( \"ENGL 1761F\") | Toni Morrison |   \n[ENGL 1761G]( \"ENGL 1761G\") | Translational Echoes of the Korean War |   \n[ENGL 1761V]( \"ENGL 1761V\") | The Korean War in Color |   \n[ENGL 1762M]( \"ENGL 1762M\") | Caribbean Literature |   \n[ENGL 1900D]( \"ENGL 1900D\") | Literature and Politics |   \n[ENGL 1901J]( \"ENGL 1901J\") | Fanon and Spillers |   \n[ENGL 1950H]( \"ENGL 1950H\") | The Recent Novel and its Cultural Rivals |   \n5. ONE course in Literary Theory and Cultural Critique: | 1  \nThe late-twentieth century saw a revolution in the field of literary studies in the United States, as critics turned their attention to the contextual and historical nature of our categories of knowledge. This turn to theory was influenced by developments in psychoanalysis, linguistics, philosophy, political theory and sociology and by the emergence of social movements that challenged such structures as patriarchy, homophobia, racism, imperialism, economic inequality, and environmental violence. The avenues of inquiry opened up brought an increased awareness of the implication of literature in the operations of power and ideology; a sense of the potential for literary modes of presentation to challenge and displace such operations; and a new attention to the role of gender, race, empire, class, and sexuality in the formation of the literary work. Courses that satisfy the Literary Theory and Cultural Critique requirement explore some dimension of these issues – either directly, taking as their primary focus a set of theoretical questions or debates, or indirectly, by examining a compelling topical question of social and political significance through works of literature and literary theory. |   \n[ENGL 0150W]( \"ENGL 0150W\") | Literature and the Visual Arts |   \n[ENGL 0700E]( \"ENGL 0700E\") | Postcolonial Literature |   \n[ENGL 0710L]( \"ENGL 0710L\") | Ishiguro, Amongst Others |   \n[ENGL 0710R]( \"ENGL 0710R\") | Poetry and Science |   \n[ENGL 0711B]( \"ENGL 0711B\") | Trans Cultural Production and Trans Studies |   \n[ENGL 0710W]( \"ENGL 0710W\") | Readings in Black and Queer |   \n[ENGL 1140A]( \"ENGL 1140A\") | Intellectual Pleasures: Reading/Writing the Literary Text |   \n[ENGL 1190S]( \"ENGL 1190S\") | Poetics of Narrative |   \n[ENGL 1511Y]( \"ENGL 1511Y\") | Emily Dickinson and the Theory of Lyric Form |   \n[ENGL 1561D]( \"ENGL 1561D\") | Writing and the Ruins of Empire |   \n[ENGL 1710M]( \"ENGL 1710M\") | Nationalizing Narratives: Race, Nationalism, and the American Novel |   \n[ENGL 1711K]( \"ENGL 1711K\") | The Politics of Perspective: Post-war British Fiction |   \n[ENGL 1711J]( \"ENGL 1711J\") | Art for an Undivided Earth / Transnational Approaches to Indigenous Art and Activism |   \n[ENGL 1760J]( \"ENGL 1760J\") | Reading _Gravity's Rainbow_ |   \n[ENGL 1761D]( \"ENGL 1761D\") | Hollywood and American Modernism from FDR to JFK |   \n[ENGL 1761L]( \"ENGL 1761L\") | Reading the Black Masses in Literature and Critical Practice |   \n[ENGL 1761Q]( \"ENGL 1761Q\") | W.

FIVE electives 2 | 5  \nTotal Credits | 10 \n\n1  \n      \nEach course may fulfill ONE requirement. Five courses must be 1000-level courses. With advisor approval, two of the ten required courses may be taken in departments other than English. \n\n2  \n    \nOnly TWO courses dealing primarily with the practice of writing at the 1000-level may be counted as electives.\nENGL0900 and ENGL0930 do not count toward the concentration, however they do fulfill prerequisites for upper-level Nonfiction courses.\nOne ENGL0200 may be counted toward the 10-course requirement only as an elective.\nAll substitutions and/or exceptions must be approved by the concentration advisor in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. A substitution or exception is not approved until specified in writing in the student’s concentration file housed in the English Department.\n### English Concentration -- Nonfiction Writing Track (10 courses)\nThe English concentration also includes a [Nonfiction Writing Track]( The requirements are the same as 1 through 6 above, but three of the five electives must be 1000-level Nonfiction Writing courses (only ONE of which may be intermediate: ENGL1030, ENGL1050). Only THREE Nonfiction courses may count toward the track.\n### Honors in English\nThe English Honors program is intended for students who have been highly successful in their English concentration coursework and who want the opportunity to pursue a research project in more depth than is possible in an undergraduate seminar. The program is intended for those students with a strong desire to conduct independent research under the supervision of a thesis advisor and culminates in the writing of a thesis during the senior year. \n**Admission**\nStudents apply to the Honors Program early in the second semester of their junior year. December or mid-year graduates may apply in their 6th semester, but are encouraged to apply during their 5th semester and write their theses alongside May graduates. Interested concentrators should speak to the Honors Advisor early in their junior year to discuss their plans. Specific deadlines for admission are announced annually and are available on the department website. Students who are studying off campus are expected to meet the application submission deadline. \nAdmission to the English Honors Program depends on evidence of ability and promise in the study of literature. To be eligible for admission, students must have received more As than Bs (and no Cs or below) in concentration courses completed. Students must complete an application; supply a brief writing sample, and request two letters of recommendation from English faculty with whom they have taken courses. If necessary, letters may come from faculty in related departments. Letters from teaching assistants may only serve as supporting recommendations. Candidates must also submit a one-page project proposal signed by the faculty member who has agreed to serve as the thesis advisor.\nSee [procedures and application]( for more details.\n_December or mid-year graduates who wish to apply to honors have two options, but the first is highly encouraged:_\nOption 1:\nIn their 5th semester (Spring), students apply to the honors program along with the other juniors. Accepted students will be incorporated into the regular honors cohort and must meet the same deadlines: i.e. they must complete their theses at the same time as the other honors students (though for mid-years this will be at the end of their 7th semester). They register for [ENGL 1991]( \"ENGL 1991\") English Honors Seminar in the Fall, and [ENGL 1992]( \"ENGL 1992\") Senior Honors Thesis in the Spring.\nOption 2:\nIn the 7th semester (the Spring of their final year), students take an independent study with their thesis advisor, under whose direction they will begin to research and write their theses. This course must be taken S/NC.  \nIn the 8th semester (the Fall of their final year), as they complete their theses, students take [ENGL 1992]( \"ENGL 1992\") for a grade. Mid-year graduates should consult with the Honors Director for information about deadlines.\n**Requirements**\nThe course requirements for the English Honors Program are the same as those for the regular concentration, with the following additions:\nAs part of regular coursework, and counting toward the concentration requirements, honors candidates must complete at least three upper-level seminars or comparable small courses in which students have the opportunity to do independent research, take significant responsibility for discussion, and do extensive scholarly and critical writing. Students are encouraged to include at least one graduate seminar in their program. (Permission to take a graduate course must be obtained from the instructor.) Honors candidates should discuss their proposed course of study with the Honors Advisor.\nDuring the Fall and Spring of the senior year, honors candidates must complete two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the regular concentration: [ENGL 1991]( \"ENGL 1991\") and [ENGL 1992]( \"ENGL 1992\"). [ENGL 1991]( \"ENGL 1991\") is the Senior Honors Seminar, in which students begin to research and write their theses, as well as meet to discuss their work. This is a mandatory S/NC course. [ENGL 1992]( \"ENGL 1992\"), the Senior Honors Thesis is an independent research course that must be taken for a grade.\nHonors candidates must continue to receive more As than Bs in courses taken as part of the concentration. Courses completed with a grade of C will not count toward an Honors concentration. A student who receives such a grade and wishes to continue in the program must complete a comparable course with a grade higher than C.\n**The Honors Thesis**\nThe Honors thesis is an extended essay, usually between 50 and 80 pages, written under the supervision of a department faculty advisor and second reader. (Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both, may be in another department.) The thesis may be an interdisciplinary or creative project, but it is usually an essay on a scholarly or critical problem dealing with works of literature in English. The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the thesis advisor, with assistance from the student's second reader. This process should begin in the latter part of the student's junior year. A good way to get an idea of what sorts of projects are possible is to visit the Hay Library, which stores theses from previous years, or to meet with the Honors Advisor.\nA prospectus describing the project and endorsed by the faculty advisor must be submitted to the Honors Advisor at the beginning of the senior year. At the end of the senior year fall term, a student must submit approximately 25 pages of draft material toward the thesis. Full thesis drafts are due by mid-March; final bound copies of the thesis are due in mid-April. Late theses will not be accepted for honors after the April deadline; students who hand in theses after the deadline but before the end of the term will receive a grade for the thesis course, but they will not be eligible for departmental honors. The completed thesis will be evaluated by the student's advisor and a second reader, each of whom provides written commentary and suggests a grade for [ENGL 1992]( \"ENGL 1992\").\n**Evaluation**\nThe English Department reviews the academic record as well as the thesis evaluations for each senior completing the Honors Program. Following a successful review, the student will be eligible to graduate with Honors in English.\n### Honors in Nonfiction Writing\nThe Nonfiction Writing Honors Program is intended for students who have been highly successful in their English concentration work. Specifically, it allows those who have an expressed and proven interest in nonfiction writing to pursue more completely a single project under the supervision of a first reader. The intention is to help students to complete work worthy of publication. The program culminates in the writing of a thesis during the senior year. \n**Admission**\nStudents apply to the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program in the second semester of their junior year. December or mid-year graduates may apply in their 6th semester, but are encouraged to apply during their 5th semester and write their theses alongside May graduates. Interested concentrators should have already made contact with at least one member of the Nonfiction Writing faculty and should meet with the Honors Advisor early in their junior year to discuss their plans. Specific deadlines for admission are announced annually and are available on the department website. Students who are studying off campus are expected to meet the application submission deadline. \nAdmission to the Honors Program in Nonfiction Writing depends upon a student's demonstrated superior ability in nonfiction writing. Students must have taken either one intermediate _and_ one advanced writing course, or two advanced writing courses by the end of their sixth semester and completed each of them with an S. To be eligible for admission, students must have earned more As than Bs (and no Cs or below) in other courses in the concentration plan. Students must submit an application, _two_ letters of recommendation, a writing sample from an advanced writing course, and a project proposal.\nSee [procedures and application]( \"Procedures for Admission to the Honors Program in Nonfiction Writing\") for more details.\n_December or mid-year graduates who wish to apply for nonfiction honors have two options, but the first is highly encouraged:_\nOption 1:\nIn their 5th semester (Spring), students can apply to the nonfiction honors program along with the other juniors. Accepted students will be incorporated into the regular nonfiction honors cohort and must meet the same deadlines: i.e. they must complete their theses at the same time as the other honors students (though for mid-years this will be at the end of their 7th semester). They register for [ENGL 1993]( \"ENGL 1993\") Nonfiction Honors Seminar in the Fall and [ENGL 1994]( \"ENGL 1994\") Senior Honors Thesis in Nonfiction in the Spring.\nOption 2:\nIn their 7th semester (the Spring of their final year) students take [ENGL 1200]( \"ENGL 1200\") and in their 8th semester (the Fall of their final year) they take [ENGL 1994]( \"ENGL 1994\"). (Students choosing this option must consult with the Honors Advisor for information on deadlines.)\n**Requirements**\nStudents in the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program take two additional courses beyond the ten courses required by the Nonfiction Writing Track -\nHonors candidates must continue to receive more As than Bs in courses taken as part of the concentration. Courses completed with a grade of C will not count toward an Honors concentration. A student who receives a \"C\" after admission to Nonfiction Honors and wishes to continue in the program must complete an additional course in a comparable subject area, with a grade higher than C.\n**The Honors Thesis**\nThe Nonfiction Writing Honors thesis is an extended project, usually of between 50 and 80 pages, written under the supervision of one of the Nonfiction Writing faculty and a second reader (who can be from literature or another department). The specific topic and approach of the thesis are worked out between the student and the first reader, with assistance from the student's second reader. A good way to get an idea of what sorts of projects are possible is to visit the Hay Library, which stores theses from previous years, or to meet with the Honors Advisor. The work typically is in a genre chosen from Nonfiction Writing's spectrum: critical analysis, literary journalism, memoir, lyric essay, or narrative based on travel, science, history, or cultural critique.\nFull thesis drafts are due by mid-March; final bound copies of the thesis are due in mid-April. Late theses will not be accepted for honors after the April deadline; students who hand in theses after the deadline and before the end of the term will receive a grade for the thesis course, but they will not be eligible for departmental honors. The completed thesis will be evaluated by its first reader and second reader, each of whom provides written commentary and suggests a grade for [ENGL 1994]( \"ENGL 1994\").\n**Evaluation**\nThe English Department reviews the academic record as well as the thesis evaluations for each senior completing the Nonfiction Writing Honors Program. Following a successful review, the student will be eligible to graduate with Honors in Nonfiction Writing.",
  "econ": "# Economics\n\nEconomics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate resources to satisfy their objectives. The study of economics helps students understand markets, firms, financial organizations, and public debate about economic policy, including taxation, government expenditure, trade, globalization, health, and welfare. The concentration in Economics prepares students for graduate study in fields such as business and law, for graduate study leading to teaching and research in economics, and can be a stepping-stone to employment in business, finance, non-profit, and government organizations. Students may choose the standard concentration, the business track, or the public policy track, all of which have a corresponding professional track. If you are interested in declaring a concentration in Economics, please refer to this page for more information regarding the process.\nStudents are required to begin with [ECON 0110]( \"ECON 0110\"), an introductory course that stresses current economic issues, and the concepts and principles of economic analysis. Intermediate level courses in microeconomics ([ECON 1110]( \"ECON 1110\") or  [ECON 1130]( \"ECON 1130\")), macroeconomics ([ECON 1210]( \"ECON 1210\")), and econometrics ([ECON 1620]( \"ECON 1620\") followed by [ECON 1629]( \"ECON 1629\") or [ECON 1630]( \"ECON 1630\") ) round out the list of foundation courses for the concentration. Economics concentrators must also fulfill a math requirement ([ECON 0170]( \"ECON 0170\")).\nThe economics department sponsors a number of concentration options. The most popular is the standard economics concentration, described below. The standard concentration has an optional Business Economics track, as well as a Public Policy track, both described below. Three additional concentration options are administered jointly with other departments and are described separately under their respective titles. They are the concentrations in applied mathematics–economics, mathematical-economics , and computer science–economics. The first two are especially recommended for students interested in graduate study in economics.\nAll concentrators in economics programs are encouraged to consult their concentration advisors regularly. Economics concentrators who wish to study abroad should consult first with the department transfer credit advisor.\n### Standard Economics Concentration\n[ECON 0110]( \"ECON 0110\") | Principles of Economics 1 | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[ECON 0170]( \"ECON 0170\") | Essential Mathematics for Economics | 1  \nor [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") |  Single Variable Calculus, Part II  \nor a higher-level math course. 2 |   \n[ECON 1110]( \"ECON 1110\") | Intermediate Microeconomics | 1  \nor [ECON 1130]( \"ECON 1130\") |  Intermediate Microeconomics (Mathematical)  \n[ECON 1210]( \"ECON 1210\") | Intermediate Macroeconomics | 1  \n[ECON 1620]( \"ECON 1620\") | Introduction to Econometrics | 1  \nor [MATH 1620]( \"MATH 1620\") |  Mathematical Statistics  \nor [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Calculus  \nor [APMA 1655]( \"APMA 1655\") |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics with Theory  \n[ECON 1629]( \"ECON 1629\") | Applied Research Methods for Economists | 1  \nor [ECON 1630]( \"ECON 1630\") |  Mathematical Econometrics I  \nAt least five additional 1000-level Economics courses. 3 | 5  \nTotal Credits | 11 \n\n1  \n      \nStudents who place out of ECON 0110 on the basis of qualifying scores on the AP, IB, or A-level exams must take an additional 1000-level course (6 instead of 5).  \n\n2  \n    \nStudents can satisfy the mathematics requirement with qualifying scores on the AP, IB, or A-level exams (but not the math department's self placement exam).

  "educ": "# Education Studies\n\nWelcome to Education Studies! Undergraduate concentrators study education in a rigorous, multi-dimensional way that allows them to investigate thorny questions of opportunity and equity in real-world settings. Our ever-expanding array of education courses allows undergraduates to explore fundamental issues of race, class, power, privilege, equity and identity through the lens of education. From introductory courses to advanced seminars, our classes examine how to teach for social justice, how students learn and develop, and how education policies promote or limit opportunity and equity.\nOur faculty includes experts in teaching and learning, human development, education policy, and the history of education. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to the field, offering courses from perspectives in anthropology, economics, history, human development, political science, social work, and sociology, among others.\n### **Concentration Requirements**\nThe concentration in Education Studies requires a total of 10 credit-bearing courses and 1 non-credit-bearing experiential component, allowing students to develop a personalized plan of study to structure their Education experiences. The new Education Studies coursework is composed of the following four elements:\n  1. Three (3) Core Courses: 2 introductory courses ([EDUC 0300]( \"EDUC 0300\") and [EDUC 0750]( \"EDUC 0750\")) will provide students with a broad-based introduction to the field of education and empirical methods used in the field, while 1 Senior Seminar, [EDUC 1900]( \"EDUC 1900\"), offers a culmination of students’ experiences in the concentration.\n  2. Four (4) Specialization Courses: Students choose 4 courses total in their planned area of emphasis within the education field. Some examples include: Education Policy Analysis; Human Development; Education and Inequality; Education for Social Justice; Adolescence; Immigrant Families, Communities & Education; Child Development; Teaching and Learning; Education and Economics; or any related topic of interest.\n  3. Three (3) Elective Courses: Students choose three courses related to the field of education and the student's field of study. One (1) independent study course can be counted towards concentration requirements. No more than 3 courses in an Education Studies concentration can come from other departments outside of Education, and all courses should be approved by the student's advisor and meaningfully tied to education. \n  4. One (1) Experiential Component: Before the beginning of the spring semester of senior year, students must complete an Experiential Component designed to promote practice-based engagement with the field of education and reflect on their experiences, tying them into their academic learning in the Education Studies concentration. Students can satisfy this requirement in one of the ways below and should then upload documentation in their ASK declaration. \n    1. ###### **By completing an existing Community-Based Learning and Research (CBLR) in the Department. OR**\n    2. ###### **By writing a paper reflecting on their experience through the lens of their coursework in the Department, the student’s academic advisor will assess the paper. OR**\n    3. ###### **By completing the Experiential Component Based (ECB) Capstone project in EDUC 1900 (Senior Seminar) OR**\n    4. ###### **By completing the reflection in an independent study-like course “Reflecting on Fieldwork.”**\n\n**Education Studies Concentration Plan of Study**\n### **Foundational Courses Required for Education Studies Concentration**\n[EDUC 0300]( \"EDUC 0300\") | Introduction to Education and Society: Foundations of Opportunity and Inequality  |   \n---|---|---  \n[EDUC 0750]( \"EDUC 0750\") | Evidence and Method in Education Research |   \n[EDUC 1900]( \"EDUC 1900\") | Senior Seminar |   \n### Other Courses in Education Studies Concentration \n4 Courses in Area of Emphasis (could include any 4 of the following) | 4  \n---|---  \n[EDUC 0515]( \"EDUC 0515\") | Teaching LGBTQIA History |   \n[EDUC 0520]( \"EDUC 0520\") | Adolescent Literature |   \n[EDUC 0530]( \"EDUC 0530\") | Fieldwork and Seminar in Secondary Education |   \n[EDUC 0610]( \"EDUC 0610\") | Brown v.

Successful candidates must meet all requirements for the concentration; maintain a minimum grade average that includes more A’s than B’s in Education courses (a B must be counterbalanced by two A's); and successfully complete [EDUC 1900]( \"EDUC 1900\") (fall) and  [EDUC 1991]( \"EDUC 1991\") (spring), in which they write a senior thesis under the guidance of a thesis advisor. Honors are awarded on the basis of thesis quality, and students whose theses meet or exceed the standards established in the Department Rubric will earn honors upon graduation. More information about writing an Honors thesis can be found on our website: <\n### Combined Baccalaureate/Master of Arts in Teaching Degree\nThe Education Department offers a combined degree program. Brown undergraduates can apply to earn both the MAT degree and a B.A. or B.S. in a subject field (English, history, math, biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and allied concentrations) in 5 years.\nBrown undergraduates can apply through the Education Department during their junior year. During their undergraduate years, candidates must complete all baccalaureate requirements and may take up to two of the required graduate courses. In their fifth year, they will complete the remaining required graduate courses, including the one-year teaching residency. The minimum requirements to complete both degrees are 36 credits, of which a maximum of two may count toward both the bachelor's degree and the MAT degree.",
  "hslc": "# Hispanic Literatures and Cultures\n\nSpanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world and the second language of the United States. In our society, knowing Spanish is not just an asset; it is increasingly a necessity. The Spanish language program offers a sequence of courses ranging from basic to advanced. Students at all levels develop proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing while also studying the cultures and societies of the contemporary Spanish-speaking world. The Hispanic Literatures and Cultures concentration enables students to develop advanced Spanish skills while acquiring a solid background in the complex history, literature, cultures, and intellectual traditions of Spain, Latin America, and the Latinx-U.S. The department offers a variety of courses on topics related to literary history and theory; multicultural contact; linguistics and the history of the language; visual culture, film, and performance studies. Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of the department, and students in this concentration are encouraged to broaden their perspectives by taking relevant courses in other departments. Most choose to strengthen their academic preparation by participating in a study abroad program in Spain or Latin America and by engaging with Latin American and Latinx communities in the United States.\n### Concentration Requirements and Overview of the Curriculum\nThe concentration requires a minimum of ten courses: one required course, [HISP 0650]( \"HISP 0650\")  _Advanced Spanish through Literature and Film_(unless waived1); up to six courses from [HISP 0550]( \"HISP 0550\"), [HISP 0600]( \"HISP 0600\") or at the 700 level; and at least three courses at the 1000 level (or equivalent with the approval of the concentration advisor). [HISP 0650]( \"HISP 0650\") gives students fundamental tools for critical analysis while also specifically targeting the development of advanced grammar and writing skills. The 700 level encompasses panoramic courses in the literary and cultural histories of Spain, Latin America, and the Latinx USA, as well as introductory courses on professional and literary translation and Spanish linguistics, all of which place emphasis on continued refinement of written and oral expression in Spanish. Courses at the 1000 level focus on particular authors, genres, periods, or special topics and introduce students to major critical voices and scholarly perspectives on the materials studied. Concentrators must take at least one Hispanic Studies course with the WRIT designation.\n1 Students can waive this course with an AP of 5 in Spanish Literature; or an SAT II of 750 or above; or a Brown Placement Score in Spanish of 651 or above. For more information on placements go to: \nStudents may count up to three related courses from outside the Hispanic Studies department toward their concentration. Eligible courses include: 1) courses that explore the literatures, histories, languages, or cultures of Spain, Latin America, or the Latinx USA, offered by other departments or programs at Brown, through study abroad programs2, or as transfer credits; 2) courses with relevant content conducted in another related foreign language such as Portuguese, Nahuatl, Quechua, Catalan, Euskera, or Galician, including both upper-division literature/culture courses and language instruction. Nota bene: A maximum of one language-learning course in a non-Spanish language, and a maximum of two courses conducted in English, may count toward the ten required concentration courses. All external courses must receive approval from the DUS, ideally obtained before enrolling. \n2 For study abroad courses, students must consult with the DUS both before and after completing their study abroad program to confirm course equivalency and ensure that the courses can be applied toward the concentration.\nThe Hispanic Studies Literatures and Cultures concentration is designed to encourage and support language-specific study, for we believe that the linguistic cultural products of the Spanish-speaking world are most deeply appreciated in the original language. Hispanic Studies courses are therefore generally taught in Spanish, unless otherwise specified in the course description. Up to two courses taken in English or another language, whether in the department or outside, can count toward the concentration.\nRequired Course: |   \n---|---  \n[HISP 0650]( \"HISP 0650\") | Advanced Spanish Through Literature & Film |   \nUp to six courses from [HISP 0550]( \"HISP 0550\"), [HISP 0600]( \"HISP 0600\"), or at the 700-level, such as: |   \n[HISP 0550]( \"HISP 0550\") | Intermediate Spanish for Heritage Speakers |   \n[HISP 0600]( \"HISP 0600\") | Advanced Spanish II |   \n[HISP 0710B]( \"HISP 0710B\") | Hispanic Culture Through Cinema |   \n[HISP 0710C]( \"HISP 0710C\") | Introducción a la lingüística hispánica |   \n[HISP 0710E]( \"HISP 0710E\") | Introduction to Professional Translation and Interpretation |   \n[HISP 0730]( \"HISP 0730\") | Encounters: Latin America in Its Literature and Culture  |   \n[HISP 0740]( \"HISP 0740\") | Intensive Survey of Spanish Literature |   \n[HISP 0750B]( \"HISP 0750B\") | The Latin American Diaspora in the US |   \n[HISP 0750G]( \"HISP 0750G\") | Wildeyed Stories |   \n[HISP 0750Q]( \"HISP 0750Q\") | Health, Illness and Medicine in Spanish and Spanish American Literature and Film |   \nAt least three 1000-level courses, such as: |   \n[HISP 1240A]( \"HISP 1240A\") | Fashion and Fiction in the Early Modern Hispanic World |   \n[HISP 1210F]( \"HISP 1210F\") | History of the Spanish Language  |   \n[HISP 1240L]( \"HISP 1240L\") | Don Quijote de la Mancha |   \n[HISP 1290W]( \"HISP 1290W\") | De abuelas a nietas: escritoras españolas y latinoamericanas de 1925 a 2025 |   \n[HISP 1330Q]( \"HISP 1330Q\") | Short Forms: Major Works in a Minor Key |   \n[HISP 1330W]( \"HISP 1330W\") | War, Revolution and the Cult of the Hero in Latin American Culture |   \n[HISP 1330Z]( \"HISP 1330Z\") | Tropical Fictions: Geography and Literature in Latin American Culture |   \n[HISP 1331E]( \"HISP 1331E\") | Visions and Voices of Indigenous Mexico  |   \n[HISP 1331J]( \"HISP 1331J\") | Hablan los hijos: A New Generation of Latin American Writers |   \n[HISP 1331U]( \"HISP 1331U\") | “You Are Here”: Mapas, Pueblos Indígenas y Mundos Nuevos |   \n[HISP 1371T]( \"HISP 1371T\") | Reimagining the Line: Contemporary Arts and Political Imagination at the Mexico-US Border |   \n[HISP 1500L]( \"HISP 1500L\") | Theory and Practice of Translation |   \n[HISP 1666]( \"HISP 1666\") | ¡Qué miedo!

Each graduating senior shares a piece of work or a text, whether studied in class or produced as an assignment, that stands out as particularly significant to their time in Hispanic Studies. This can take several forms: it can be an extract from a poem, novel, play, or critical essay; it can also be a film or music clip or piece of art; or, a translation done by the student, or an original creative text.\n### Honors Thesis or Project\nStudents with an excellent record in their Hispanic Studies courses will be eligible to write an Honors Thesis or write and produce an Honors Project. Students pursuing honors must have a record of all A’s or a final grade of S with distinction in courses they have as S/NC. Typically, the Honors Thesis is a major research paper of approximately 40 to 80 pages in Spanish, depending on the topic and treatment necessary. Alternatively, a student may, with prior permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, present a film, gallery exhibition, or other appropriate project, together with a paper that clearly demonstrates the academic foundations and relevance of the project.

  "hhbi": "# Health & Human Biology\n\nHealth and Human Biology is an interdisciplinary concentration that provides a rigorous foundation in the biological sciences with substantive course work in humanities and social sciences within a subfield of Human Health and Disease. The program includes: background courses, biology core courses, a set of theme courses, and a Senior Capstone activity. Background courses provide the essential foundations in chemistry, mathematics, methods, and basic biology. These support the Biology core, which is comprised of a flexible menu of intermediate and advanced courses. A required portion of the Biology core is Genetics, a cornerstone of human biology and its interface with other fields. The Biology core underscores the related coursework within the Health and Disease Theme. The Theme courses are social science and humanities courses that form a cohesive, thoughtful grouping.

  "maeg": "# Materials Engineering\n\nMaterials engineers design, create, and manufacture materials which include semiconductors, polymers, ceramics, metal alloys, and composites. Their contributions have led to breakthroughs in many fields including computing, communications, automobiles, energy, aerospace, buildings/infrastructure, and biomedical devices. The Materials Engineering curriculum at Brown provides graduates with both the expertise necessary to practice their profession as well as the interdisciplinary foundation necessary to collaborate with the engineers who will use the materials that they develop. A substantial fraction of Materials Engineering students at Brown participate in research which allows them to make use of Brown's state-of-the-art facilities in microscopy, materials characterization, materials processing, and fabrication.\nThe Materials Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, < The Program Educational Objectives PEOs of the Materials Engineering Sc.B. Program are to are to prepare the graduates: (1) To build on the knowledge gained in their undergraduate program in terms of strong engineering fundamentals, a specific strength in materials engineering, advanced written and verbal communication, and societal awareness and engagement, as well as new knowledge learned in their first years of employment or graduate school, to move toward positions of responsibility, leadership, and influence in the field; and (2) to be viewed as outstanding engineering leaders, whether in start-ups or multinational corporations or academia, in terms of technical competence and in their understanding of an engineer’s responsibility to society and to ethical behavior. Through this reputation they will be having a significant organizational influence in their work. The student outcomes of this program are the (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher-level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of  [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures.) In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n1.

  "iapa": "# International and Public Affairs\n\nThe concentration in International and Public Affairs equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be engaged global citizens. This concentration offers three tracks: Development, Policy & Governance, and Security. All students take a common core of five classes, beginning with a choice of thematic gateway lecture courses (ideally taken during freshman or sophomore year), and then building through a required junior seminar and a required senior seminar (eligible students may choose to write an honor's thesis to satisfy the senior seminar requirement). All students choose one of three tracks of substantive specialization: Development, in which students explore issues of human development in local and global contexts, and across both the developing world and advanced industrial settings; Security, which allows students to explore issues of security in both local and global contexts; and Policy and Governance, in which students explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of public policies to resolve societal challenges, as well as the governing structures that yield those policies. The concentration is committed to engaging students in the classroom, enabling research opportunities with faculty and in the field, and supporting experiential learning opportunities. Advisors' office hours and an online appointment scheduler are available here.\n### Concentration Requirements\nThe concentration comprises 11 courses (12 for an honors degree). Students take a Gateway course, which introduces them to multidisciplinary perspectives on social challenges that cut across global regions. The Foundational course introduces students to central themes and texts in the three IAPA tracks: Development, Policy and Governance, and Security. Gateway and Track Foundational courses are not interchangeable or substitutable with courses offered in other concentrations. They should both be taken in the first or second year.\nOnce a student has chosen a track, they take five electives, selected from a pre-approved list for each track on our website. Approval of track elective courses not on the pre-approved list is permitted only in extenuating circumstances. Note that that list of electives is subject to change. We encourage students to cluster two or three of these electives around a region, theme, or social problem to create coherence in their plan of study and prepare for future work. \nStudents also take courses in qualitative and quantitative methods (a high-level course in language instruction can substitute for one of the two methods courses). \nAll International and Public Affairs concentrators take a junior seminar (1700 level) during the fall or spring semester of the junior year. The seminars, which are not track specific, focus on issues in international and public affairs that can be studied in comparative perspective, that can be subjected to multidisciplinary analysis, and that often cut across concerns about development, policy and governance, and security. The seminars are designed to help students hone skills of critical thinking, argumentation, and the design and operation of social science research and scholarship. Junior seminar students write papers on topics that can later be pursued as capstone or thesis projects. Junior seminars are not interchangeable or substitutable with courses in other concentrations. Junior seminars are typically WRIT-designated.\nAll International and Public Affairs concentrators complete a capstone course during their senior year. Designated IAPA Senior Seminars (1800 level) require students to write a research paper or extended policy brief that draws on analytic expertise, thematic expertise, regional expertise, and foreign language skills, if applicable. The capstone research project is typically about 20-25 pages in length. Senior capstone seminars are not interchangeable or substitutable with courses offered in other concentrations. Senior seminars are typically WRIT-designated. Eligible seniors may choose to write a two-semester honors thesis to satisfy the senior capstone requirement.\n### **Track Specialization and Electives**\nIAPA students must take the track foundational course associated with their track specialization (Development, Security, or Policy & Governance). Track foundational courses are not interchangeable or substitutable with courses offered in other concentrations.

  "gnss": "# Gender and Sexuality Studies\n\nGender and Sexuality Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration that examines the construction of gender and sexuality in social, cultural, political, economic, and scientific contexts.\nEach Gender and Sexuality Studies (GNSS) concentrator develops a well-defined topic or question and works closely with an advisor to design a program that rigorously investigates their focus area and supplements it with foundational courses in the relevant disciplines.\nGraduates of GNSS have focused on topics such as intersex healthcare, trans memoir, queer archival practice, incest in the postbellum South, racial disparities in reproductive healthcare, sex positivity in the #MeToo era, comparative models of sex education, garment workers and environmental justice, and LGBTQ+ migration. Introductory and methodology courses in the discipline appropriate to the concentrator's research area provide knowledge of the principles grounding their research methods in order to deploy disciplinary tools or challenge disciplinary boundaries with intentionality.\nMore information is available on the Gender and Sexuality Studies website.\n### Requirements:\nThe concentration requires 10 courses, 12 for honors concentrators. No more than two courses may count for multiple concentrations.\n  1. [GNSS 0120]( \"GNSS 0120\"). Introductory course on gender and sexuality across the disciplines\n  2. Four–course focus on some thematic, theoretical, or historical aspect of gender and sexuality\n  3. Two introductory or methodology courses in disciplines pertinent to the focus\n  4. One course in gender history, women's history, or history of sexuality\n  5. One course in feminist theory or theory of sexuality\n  6. [GNSS 1990]( \"GNSS 1990\"). A senior seminar which counts as your capstone course. Senior seminar participants are expected to write a research essay. The senior seminar fulfills the second half of Brown's writing requirement.\n  7. Prior to Commencement, all graduating senior concentrators are required to give a short presentation of either their senior essay or thesis project.\n\n### Honors\nCandidates for honors must apply to the program's director at the beginning of their seventh semester. Honors concentrators fulfill the regular requirements plus completing a two–semester thesis as their capstone project.\nFor more information, please consult the GNSS concentration webpage at <",
  "ling": "# Linguistics\n\nLanguage is a uniquely human capacity that enables us to communicate a limitless set of messages on any topic. While human languages can differ greatly in certain respects, all are intricate, complex, rule-governed systems. Linguistics is the scientific study of these systems, their use for communication in rich social settings, and their cognitive underpinnings. The linguistics concentration at Brown introduces students with the basic concepts in linguistics that are necessary to describe human languages and theorize about them: how sound is organized in language, how sounds and gestures combine to form meaningful units, and how language is used for communication. It encourages students to acquire an appreciation of the different kinds of variation in human languages: what is common to different languages, how languages can differ from one another, and how speech communities and individuals vary in their use of language. It familiarizes students with a wide variety of topics in linguistics, including psycholinguistics, language change, language and society, computational approaches to language, and philosophy of language. Furthermore, the concentration lets students acquire hands-on experience in understanding and solving open-ended questions in linguistics, which would include comparing the merits of competing theoretical approaches, and teaches them how to communicate linguistic arguments effectively in writing and in presentations.\nStudents who wish to pursue one or more aspects of Linguistics in greater depth than required by the Bachelor of Arts, and to focus on some of the more technical, computational, and/or experimental areas of the field may choose to take a Bachelor of Science in Linguistics instead. Students will form a collection of classes that combines expertise in linguistics and in adjacent fields. For instance, students may combine their interest in linguistics with classes in cognitive science, philosophy, or computer science, with approval from the concentration advisor.\n### A.B. Requirements (10 courses)\nStudents are expected to fulfill both breadth and depth requirements. Breadth requirements let students reach common ground understanding of topics in linguistics, and include an introductory gateway course, a class that focuses on phonetics / phonology, a class that focuses on syntax / morphology, a class that focuses on semantics / pragmatics, and a class on language variation. Depth requirements expect students to gain more specialized knowledge in specific domains, by taking additional courses, some of which must be methods / advanced courses, as described below. \nGateway Course  | 1  \n---|---  \n[LING 0100]( \"LING 0100\") | Introduction to Linguistics |   \nPhonetics/Phonology Courses | 1  \n[LING 1200]( \"LING 1200\") | Phonology |   \n[LING 1210]( \"LING 1210\") | Phonetics |   \nSyntax Courses | 1  \n[LING 1310]( \"LING 1310\") | Introduction to Syntax |   \n[LING 1311]( \"LING 1311\") | Linguistic Variation and Universals |   \nSemantics/Pragmatics Courses | 1  \n[LING 1410]( \"LING 1410\") | Lexical Semantics |   \n[LING 1440]( \"LING 1440\") | Compositional Semantics |   \n[LING 1412]( \"LING 1412\") | Pragmatics |   \nLinguistic Variation Courses | 1  \n[LING 1500]( \"LING 1500\") | Sociolinguistics |   \n[LING 0511]( \"LING 0511\") | Language and Gender |   \n[LING 1311]( \"LING 1311\") | Linguistic Variation and Universals |   \n[CPSY 0800]( \"CPSY 0800\") | Language and the Mind |   \n[CPSY 1650]( \"CPSY 1650\") | Child Language Acquisition |   \n[CPSY 1660]( \"CPSY 1660\") | Learning Compositional Language |   \n[CPSY 1800]( \"CPSY 1800\") | Language Processing |   \n[CPSY 1850]( \"CPSY 1850\") | Language Processing in Humans and Machines |   \n[CPSY 1890]( \"CPSY 1890\") | Laboratory in Psycholinguistics |   \n5 additional appropriate electives forming a thematically related set to be determined in consultation with the Concentration Advisor. At least one of these must be drawn from the list of advanced courses listed below, and we strongly recommend that at least one course be an appropriate methods and a topics course. No more than 2 of these courses may be drawn from below 1000 level courses. The electives can be drawn from any of the above courses, or any of the other linguistic/language related courses in the program. Electives may also be drawn from courses in other departments in consultation with the Concentration Advisor; a list of courses which standardly count towards the Linguistics Concentration (provided they form part of the thematically related set) is appended below. | 5  \n[CPSY 1650]( \"CPSY 1650\") | Child Language Acquisition |   \n[SLAV 1300]( \"SLAV 1300\") | Language and Politics in East Europe and Russia |   \nAdvanced and Methods Courses |   \n[LING 1440]( \"LING 1440\") | Compositional Semantics |   \n[LING 1771]( \"LING 1771\") | Introduction to Corpus Linguistics |   \n[LING 1870]( \"LING 1870\") | Linguistic Field Methods |   \n[CSCI 1460]( \"CSCI 1460\") | Computational Linguistics |   \n[CPSY 1890]( \"CPSY 1890\") | Laboratory in Psycholinguistics |   \nNOTE: This is NOT an exhaustive list of courses that can be applied towards the Linguistics Concentration requirements. |   \nTotal Credits | 10  \nIndependent study is encouraged for the A.B. degree. Students should sign up for LING 19XX with a faculty advisor who is a member of the Program in Linguistics. Arrangements should be made in Semester 6 for students expecting to do independent study during Semesters 7 and/or 8.\n**Honors (12 courses)**\nCandidates for Honors in Linguistics must meet all of the requirements above, write an Honors thesis, and take two additional courses. One course is normally LING 19XX (Directed Research in Linguistics) - intended for work on the Honors thesis.\nThree of the total 12 courses must be drawn from the advanced list above (the Directed Research course counts as one of the advanced courses).\nRefer to the Program in Linguistics webpage for detailed information about the Linguistics Honors program.\n### ScB Requirements (16 courses)\nStudents who wish to pursue one or more aspects of Linguistics in greater depth than does the A.B., and to focus on some of the more technical, computational, and/or experimental areas of the field may choose to take an Sc.B in Linguistics. Students will choose a focus pathway, in consultation with the Concentration Advisor / Director of Undergraduate Studies, which will direct their choices.\nStudents are expected to fulfill both breadth and depth requirements. Breadth requirements let students reach common ground understanding of topics in linguistics, and include an introductory gateway course, a class that focuses on phonetics / phonology, a class that focuses on syntax / morphology, a class that focuses on semantics / pragmatics, and a class on language variation. Depth requirements expect students to gain more specialized knowledge in specific domains, by taking additional courses, some of which must be methods / advanced courses, as described below.

The student’s work will culminate in an Honors’ thesis on an approved topic (learn more about regulations regarding Honors’ theses at < written under the direction of one or more faculty members, and read by a committee of at least two faculty members (one of whom may be from another department).\n# General Guidelines\n### Do Foreign Language Courses Count?\nForeign language courses will generally not count towards the concentration requirements, except those that focus on the structure or history of the language. Students are, however, advised to gain familiarity with a foreign language, and are encouraged to take at least one course which deals with the structure of a language other than English.\n### Choice of Electives\nWhen it comes to the choice of electives, students can complement LING classes with classes that have substantial linguistics content in other departments. However, the specific choice of electives depends on the other classes the student is taking. Students should consult with the concentration adviser / the director of undergraduate studies regarding their specific choices. Additionally, no more than two electives can be 0-level courses.\n### Overlapping Classes\nLinguistics allows students to double-count at most two classes with other concentrations.\n###### NOTE: Please refer to the undergraduate Linguistics concentration site for updates not listed here.",
  "macs": "# Mathematics-Computer Science\n\nStudents may opt to pursue an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree in Math-Computer Science, a concentration administered cooperatively between the mathematics and computer science departments. Course requirements include math- and systems-oriented computer science courses, as well as computational courses in applied math.

  "hist": "# History\n\nHistory is the study of how societies and cultures across the world change over time. History concentrators learn to write and think critically, and to understand issues from a variety of perspectives. The department offers a wide variety of courses concerned with changes in human experience through time, ranging from classical Greek and Roman civilizations to the histories of Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, and Asia. While some courses explore special topics, others concentrate on the history of a particular country (e.g. China or Brazil) or period of time (e.g. Antiquity or the 20th century). By taking advantage of our diverse course offerings, students can engage in and develop broad perspectives on the past and the present.\nProspective concentrators should visit the History site and visit the office hours of their prospective concentrator advisor (assigned according to student surname).\n### Concentration Requirements \n**Basic requirement:** A minimum of 10 courses, at least 8 of which must be courses taught by a [Brown University History Department faculty member]( (including their cross-listed courses) and/or courses offered by the Brown History Department (such as those taught by Visiting or Adjunct Professors). Transfer students or study-abroad students who have spent a year or more at another institution must have at least 7 of 10 history courses taught by Brown History faculty or otherwise offered through the Brown History Department.\nSummary |   \n---|---  \nTwo (2) Courses in the \"Premodern\" era (P) |   \nOne (1) Course in Africa OR Middle East - South Asia |   \nOne (1) Course in East Asia OR Latin America |   \nOne (1) course in Europe OR North America |   \nOne (1) course designated Global |   \nStudents may take a maximum of 5 courses in any single geography |   \nField of Focus (FF) - Students must take four courses in the field of focus. These courses may be used to satisfy different requirements (geography and field of focus, etc.).  |   \nCapstone Seminar: All concentrators must complete at least one capstone seminar (HIST 1960s and HIST 1970s series and select HIST 1980s courses), ideally, in the field of focus.  |   \nHonors (optional) 3 additional courses related to writing a thesis (one of which, [HIST 1992]( \"HIST 1992\"), can count towards your 10 concentration requirements) |   \nNote: Courses can fulfill more than one of these requirements at a time. For instance, HIST1963Q “Sex, Power, God: A Medieval Perspective” would count as “Premodern,” a \"Europe\" class, and a capstone seminar. It could also count towards a field of focus in premodern Europe or the history of sexuality or the history of religion, etc.\n**Courses below 1000** _:_ Students may count no more than four courses numbered below 1000 toward the concentration requirements. Students considering a concentration in History are encouraged to take First Year and Sophomore seminars, as well as courses in the HIST 0150 and 0200 series, for an introduction to historical reasoning, discussion, and writing.\n**Field of focus:** In History, concentrators choose or create their own “track,” rather than having to select an existing track. The field of focus must include a minimum of four courses, and it may be: geographical (such as Latin America); geographical and chronological (such as Modern North America); or transnational (such as ancient world); or thematic (such as urban history). All students should consult a concentration advisor early in the process about their potential field of focus. All fields are subject to approval by the concentration advisor.\nThematic fields of focus include but are not restricted to:\n  * Comparative Colonialism\n  * Gender and Sexuality\n  * Law and Society\n  * Race and Ethnicity\n  * Science, Technology, Environment and Medicine (STEAM)\n  * Urban History\n\nExamples of transnational foci include:\n  * The Ancient World\n  * The Early Modern Atlantic World\n  * Africa and the Diaspora\n  * The Mediterranean World from Antiquity to the Middle Ages\n  * The Pacific World\n\n**Geographic Distribution:** Concentrators must take a at least four courses defined by geography as follows:\n  * One course in Africa or Middle East-South Asia\n  * One course in East Asia or Latin America\n  * One course in Europe or North America\n  * One course in Global\n\nMaximum of five courses in a single geography\n“Global” courses are defined as those that deal with at least three different regions of the world.\nFor details on which courses count toward which geographical distribution requirement click [here](\n**Chronological Distribution:** All concentrators must complete at least two courses designated as “P” (for pre-modern).\nFor a listing of which courses count as \"P\" courses [click here](\n**Capstone Seminar:** All concentrators must complete at least one capstone seminar (HIST 1960s and HIST 1970s series and select HIST 1980s courses). They provide students with an opportunity to delve deeply into a historical problem and to write a major research and/or analytical paper which serves as a capstone experience. Students considering writing a senior honors thesis are advised to take an advanced seminar in their junior year. First-Year students are not advised to take these courses. \n**Transferring Courses:** The History Department encourages students to take history courses at other institutions, either in the United States or abroad, as well as history-oriented courses in other departments and programs at Brown. Students may apply two courses taken in other departments/programs at Brown to the ten-course minimum for the History concentration. Students who spend one semester at another institution may apply to their concentration a maximum of two courses from other departments or institutions, and those who spend more than one semester at another institution may apply to their concentration a third course transferred from another institution.\nStudents wishing to apply such courses must present to their concentration advisor justification that those courses complement some aspect of their concentration. Courses from other Brown departments _may not_ be applied toward the chronological distribution requirement. History courses taught by trained historians from other institutions (e.g., from study abroad or a previous institution) _may_ be applied toward the chronological distribution requirement so long as at least 2/3 of the course content examine the \"premodern\" or \"early modern\" periods.\nIt is normally expected that students will have declared their intention to concentrate in History and have their concentration programs approved before undertaking study elsewhere. Students taking courses in Brown-run programs abroad automatically receive University transfer credit, but concentration credit is granted only with the approval of a concentration advisor. Students taking courses in other foreign-study programs or at other universities in the United States must apply to the Transfer Credit Advisor and then get approval from a concentration advisor.\n**Regular Consultation:** Students are strongly urged to consult regularly with their concentration advisor or a department advisor about their program. During the seventh semester, all students must meet with their concentration advisor for review and approval of their program.\nCOURSES BELOW 1000 |   \n---|---  \nLECTURE COURSES |   \n150's:

To be admitted, students must have achieved two-thirds “quality grades” in History department courses. A “quality grade” is defined as a grade of “A” or a grade of “S” accompanied by a course performance report indicating a performance at the “A” standard.\nStudents who wish to enroll in honors are recommended to take[HIST 1992]( \"HIST 1992\"), “History Honors Workshop for Prospective Students.” [HIST 1992]( \"HIST 1992\") can count as one of the 10 courses required for graduation in history. [HIST 1992]( \"HIST 1992\") students who prepare a prospectus that receives a grade of A- or above will be admitted to the honors program. Students in their 7th semester who have not taken [HIST 1992]( \"HIST 1992\") (including but not limited to those who are away from Brown during that semester) may apply to the program by submitting a prospectus no later than the first day of that semester. All honors students must complete one semester of [HIST 1993]( \"HIST 1993\") “History Honors Workshop for Thesis Writers, Part I” and one semester of [HIST 1994]( \"HIST 1994\") “History Workshop for Thesis Writers, Part II.” HIST 1993 and HIST 1994 do not count towards the 10 courses required for graduation in history; they are an additional two courses to the minimum of 10 required history courses. Students who contemplate enrolling in the honors program in History should consult the honors section of the department website. They are also encouraged to meet with the Director of the Honors Program (DHP), who serves as the honors advisor.",
  "gmst": "# German Studies\n\nGerman Studies exposes students to the language, literature, and culture of the German speaking areas of Central Europe. Concentrators combine intensive study of the German language with interdisciplinary studies by complementing courses from the German Studies core program with courses from other departments that deal with topics from the German cultural tradition. The quest for national identity that dominated German history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has been augmented by contemporary Germany's efforts to come to terms with its past and create new ways of dealing with diversity. Our curriculum therefore looks back at the German literary, cultural, and historical tradition, examining figures from Goethe or Christa Wolf to Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, alongside the “texts” of contemporary German media, including television, film, and music. Most concentrators study abroad for one or two semesters.  \n\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree\nMany students elect to complete a double concentration, combining German Studies with one of the above areas, or with fields such as International Relations or Economics, Comparative Literature or History of Art and Architecture.\nKnowledge of the German language is not required for declaring a concentration in German Studies. However, since language fluency is the basis for sophisticated understanding of German culture, students must meet a language requirement by the time they graduate.\n### Concentration Requirements\n  * Nine courses beyond [GRMN 0400]( \"GRMN 0400\") or [GRMN 0450]( \"GRMN 0450\");\n  * At least six of the nine courses must be at the 1000-level (or higher);\n  * Two of the 1000-level courses must involve writing assignments in German, and students must obtain at least a grade of B in these courses;\n  * At least five of the nine courses must be taken in the Department of German Studies (or four if a student spends a whole year in Germany on Study Abroad);\n  * Completion of a Senior Seminar (i.e. a course from the German Studies 1900 series) as part of the five courses within the Department of German Studies; and\n  * If a student studies abroad for one semester, as many as four courses, in the case of two semesters, as many as five courses, from study abroad may count toward the concentration.\n\n[GRMN 0500F]( \"GRMN 0500F\") | Twentieth-Century German Culture |   \n---|---|---  \n[GRMN 0600C]( \"GRMN 0600C\") | From Faust to Freud: Germany’s Long 19th Century |   \n[GRMN 0750B]( \"GRMN 0750B\") | Tales of Vampirism and the Uncanny |   \n[GRMN 0750D]( \"GRMN 0750D\") | The Poetics of Murder: Crime Fiction from Poe to the Present |   \n[GRMN 0750F]( \"GRMN 0750F\") | Historical Crime Fiction  |   \n[GRMN 1200C]( \"GRMN 1200C\") | Nietzsche - The Good European |   \n[GRMN 1200D]( \"GRMN 1200D\") | Repetition: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Freud |   \n[GRMN 1320A]( \"GRMN 1320A\") | German Aesthetics from Lessing to Heidegger |   \n[GRMN 1320D]( \"GRMN 1320D\") | Goethe |   \n[GRMN 1320E]( \"GRMN 1320E\") | Classical German Literature: Goethe und die Klassik |   \n[GRMN 1320F]( \"GRMN 1320F\") | Eighteenth-Century German Aesthetics |   \n[GRMN 1320G]( \"GRMN 1320G\") | Drama and Religion |   \n[GRMN 1320I]( \"GRMN 1320I\") | What is an Image?

  "hiaa": "# History of Art and Architecture\n\nThe concentration in History of Art and Architecture (HIAA) introduces students to the history of art, architecture, and material culture. Students in HIAA explore a wide range of artistic traditions from around the world, and develop the skills necessary to analyze artworks, artifacts, and the built environment dating from the paleolithic to the contemporary. Concentrators are encouraged to develop familiarity with the distinctive periods, regions, sub-fields, and theoretical approaches that collectively inform the discipline, while at the same time developing an individualized program. Concentrators will receive essential training in perceptual, historical, and critical analysis.\n### History of Art and Architecture Requirements\nTo complete the concentration, you will be expected to take a minimum of ten courses. Our goal in setting out these requirements is to welcome students into a lively and diverse department that also shares a cohesive and strong commitment to the field. We as a faculty want students to cultivate their special interests and also to venture into areas that may not be so familiar but that will open new and exciting possibilities for them. Ten courses are only the minimum requirement. Beyond that students are encouraged to take courses at RISD, participate in study abroad programs, and take courses in other Brown departments. As we are a truly interdisciplinary department, you will also find that our faculty collaborates with members of other departments to teach courses that bring together the strengths of different disciplines. We encourage both experimentation and concentration.\nSince the history of art and architecture addresses issues of practice within specific historical contexts, concentrators are encouraged to take at least one studio art course. Courses in history also train students in methods and approaches that are highly relevant to the history of art and architecture. Study abroad can be a valuable enrichment of the academic work available on campus, in that it offers opportunities for first-hand knowledge of works of art and monuments as well as providing exposure to foreign languages and cultures. Study abroad should be planned in consultation with the concentration advisor in order to make sure that coursework will relate meaningfully to the concentrators program of study.\n5 Lecture Courses, numbered HIAA 0001–HIAA 0999. The courses should engage at least three different geographic regions (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe) and two different periods (Ancient-Medieval, Early Modern, Modern-Contemporary). Individual courses can be used to fulfill either the geographic or temporal breadth requirement, but not both. Courses tagged as “Multiple Regions” and “Multiple Periods” can be used to fulfill one geographic and one temporal breadth requirement, respectively. | 5  \n---|---  \nTemporal Periods |

Capstone projects are required for all concentrators. The Capstone is intended to challenge you with an opportunity to synthesize at a high level of achievement the knowledge and understanding you have gained by concentrating in the History of Art and Architecture. Capstone projects embrace many possibilities. You can perfect a seminar paper in which you have developed a strong interest. You can participate in a graduate seminar to which the instructor has admitted you. You can develop work that you do as a museum or gallery intern. You might work on an archaeological excavation. You can participate in the Honors Program. Beyond these opportunities, the Department is open to other approaches. Capstones are often completed under the auspices of an independent study course. But a capstone may be completed under the umbrella of an existing course. All capstone’s must be discussed with and approved by a faculty sponsor and your concentration advisor. | 1  \nTotal Credits | 10 \n\n1  \n      \nA maximum of four credits may be allowed for courses taken at other universities (transfer credits or from study abroad) or courses on art historical subjects taken in other departments. No concentration credit will be granted for AP/IB/A-level scores. \n### Self-Assessment\nAll concentrators are required to write an essay when they file for the concentration that lays out what they expect to gain from the course of study they propose. All second-semester seniors will be required to write a final essay that takes measure of what they have learned from the concentration, including their capstone and other experiences relating to their study of the history of art and architecture. The self-assessment should be submitted through ASK with a revised list of courses actually taken at least one month prior to graduation.\n### Honors\nDuring the second semester of the junior year all concentrators will be invited to apply for admission to the Honors Program in History of Art and Architecture. The honors program is an opportunity for concentrators to mobilize what they have learned to make an original research contribution to the field.\nStudents wishing to write an honors thesis should have produced consistently excellent work and maintained a high level of achievement (i.e. a majority of “A” or “S with distinction” grades) in all concentration courses. It is advisable for them to have taken at least one seminar in the department and written a research paper before choosing to undertake a thesis. Acceptance into the Honors program depends on the persuasiveness of the thesis topic and the availability of relevant faculty to advise the thesis. No honors student may take more than four courses either semester of their senior year—with the honors seminar being considered one of the four courses. Students interested in honors who are expecting to graduate in the middle of the year should contact the concentration advisor no later than the beginning of their junior year.\nDuring both fall and spring semesters you will participate in the monthly meetings of the Honors cohort, in which honors students in both HIAA concentrations share their work-in-progress with each other and with the faculty member who supervises the seminar. These monthly meetings, usually three per semester, are mandatory. Students must enroll in [HIAA 1990]( \"HIAA 1990\") (Honors Thesis) in both semesters. Students are also expected to meet separately and regularly with their own thesis advisor.\nFinished drafts of the thesis, which will generally be no more than 30–35 pages in length (exceptions to be determined in consultation with the instructor), not counting bibliography and visual materials, will be due to the advisor and second reader by March 1 of the Spring semester or by November 1 of the Fall semester if you plan on graduating in December. Comments will be returned to the students for final corrections at that point. There will be a public presentation of Honors work at the end of the Spring semester.",
  "ffs": "# French and Francophone Studies\n\nThe concentration in French and Francophone Studies is committed to the pursuit of an interdisciplinary, linguistically rigorous, and textually informed understanding of French and Francophone literatures and cultures. Concentrators engage actively through their coursework with a wide range of texts and critical perspectives, pertaining to multiple literary genres, media, and contexts. They have opportunities to study different periods of French history as well as Francophone cultures beyond France.\n### **Concentration Requirements**\nA minimum of ten courses is required for the concentration in French and Francophone Studies. Concentrators must observe the following guidelines when planning their concentration. It is recommended that course choices for each semester be discussed with the department’s concentration advisor.\nOf the minimum ten courses:\nAt least four courses in French and Francophone Studies numbered 950 and above, such as: |   \n---|---  \n[FREN 0950A]( \"FREN 0950A\") | Advanced Written and Oral French: Traduction | 1  \n[FREN 0960A]( \"FREN 0960A\") | Ateliers d'écriture | 1  \n[FREN 1070M]( \"FREN 1070M\") | La question animale  | 1  \n[FREN 1110F]( \"FREN 1110F\") | Le Roman contemporain | 1  \n[FREN 1120F]( \"FREN 1120F\") | L'enfer, c'est les autres | 1  \n[FREN 1130G]( \"FREN 1130G\") | Modernismes poétiques | 1  \n[FREN 1210F]( \"FREN 1210F\") | L’œuvre romanesque de Marguerite Duras | 1  \n[FREN 1310N]( \"FREN 1310N\") | La Pornographie | 1  \n[FREN 1310P]( \"FREN 1310P\") | La théorie féministe en France | 1  \n[FREN 1410X]( \"FREN 1410X\") | Dés/Accords franco-américains  | 1  \nAt least one course covering a pre-Revolutionary period (i.e. a course focusing on medieval, Renaissance, 17th or 18th century France), such as: |   \n---|---  \n[FREN 1000B]( \"FREN 1000B\") | Littérature et culture: Chevaliers, sorcières, philosophes, et poètes | 1  \n[FREN 1040B]( \"FREN 1040B\") | Pouvoirs de la scène: le théâtre du XVIIe siècle | 1  \n[FREN 1040C]( \"FREN 1040C\") | Le Grand Siècle à l'écran | 1  \n[FREN 1040D]( \"FREN 1040D\") | Molière et son monde | 1  \n[FREN 1410I]( \"FREN 1410I\") | Sorcellerie et Renaissance: le sort de la sorcière | 1  \nAt least one course focusing primarily on a Francophone literature or a cultural context other than that of France, such as: |   \n---|---  \n[FREN 1410R]( \"FREN 1410R\") | Images d’une guerre sans nom: The Algerian War in Literature and Film | 1  \n[FREN 1410T]( \"FREN 1410T\") | L'experience des refugies: deplacements, migrations | 1  \n  * [FREN 0600]( \"FREN 0600\"), [FREN 0610]( \"FREN 0610\"), and [FREN 0620]( \"FREN 0620\")(Advanced French) and FREN720 (First Year Seminar) may count for concentration credit\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n  * A [senior capstone project]( will be completed during the senior year.\n  * Up to four courses (taken in French) from a semester’s study abroad (and up to five courses from a full year abroad) may count towards the concentration.

As a culminating piece of work for their concentration, it is a conceptually rigorous, in-depth treatment of a subject (or a body of work) within French and Francophone Studies, and an opportunity for concentrators to demonstrate the specific strengths and forms of competence—linguistic, analytic, interpretive, critical, theoretical, cultural—developed in the course of the concentration. The learning goals of the capstone project include: building on writing proficiency in French, demonstrating critical reasoning skills, and showing, in writing, the ability to engage thoughtfully with salient questions of French and/or Francophone culture.\nThe senior capstone experience is usually fulfilled by a research essay completed for a 1000-level (or a 2000-level) course taken in the department during the senior year. In some cases, where appropriate to the course materials and focus, the capstone project may take the form of a work of translation or a piece of creative writing. The project will be 8-12 pages in length and will be written in French. By mid-semester, students will submit to the professor of the course a 300-word statement of the objectives and methods of the project. Students will then meet with the professor to discuss plans for the project. At the end of the academic year, students will give a presentation of 5-7 minutes on their projects at the annual Senior Forum. The professor evaluating the project will inform the DUS of successful completion of the capstone project.\nIn the case of students pursuing Honors, the senior thesis fulfills the role of the senior capstone. \nThe senior capstone is intended as a meaningful scholarly experience where concentrators may follow their intellectual passions and best express their growth as students of French and Francophone Studies. Concentrators should discuss their plans for the senior capstone with the Concentration Advisor at the end of their junior year or the beginning of their senior year.\n### **Honors**\nThe Honors Program welcomes applications from students who wish to deepen their study of French and Francophone literature and culture by pursuing during their senior year an independent research-based inquiry into a particular set of texts or questions (literary, historical, cultural, theoretical or linguistic), a translation project or a creative work under the supervision of a thesis advisor. Students may earn honors in the concentration by successfully presenting a thesis, for the preparation of which they will normally enroll in FREN 1990 in either or both semesters of their senior year. \n### **Eligibility and Application Procedure**\nCandidates for honors in French Studies are expected to have a strong track record in courses taken for their concentration, and will have completed at least two-thirds of the courses required for the concentration (6 courses) by the application deadline.\nApplications for admission to the Honors Program are submitted by the end of September in the student’s seventh semester. This means that the candidate should ideally begin to think of their thesis project, and establish contact with a potential thesis advisor by the end of the spring semester of their junior year or in the first weeks of the fall semester of their senior year. Students generally choose as advisor a faculty member with whom they have taken a class, but they are also encouraged to contact others whose specialization aligns with their interests. If in doubt, the concentration advisor can be consulted for suggestions of an appropriate advisor. (Note that faculty may not be easy to contact over the summer. Students are thus advised to seek contact during the academic year.) For the application (form available below), the student will provide a brief thesis proposal (1 or 2 paragraphs in French presenting the object of study and intended approach). The application must also feature a thesis title, the name and signature of the thesis advisor, and two recommendations from French and Francophone Studies faculty. Upon admission, the student will also choose a second reader.\nStudents applying for admission to the Honors Program must submit a completed [application]( to the French Studies Honors/Concentration Advisor by **September 26** (or the weekday closest to that date). Recommendations should be from department faculty who have close knowledge of the student's work, preferably through a course taken by the student during their sophomore or junior year. **Please submit these forms to your faculty recommenders no later than September 18** (or the weekday closest to that date). They will then be forwarded to the Honors Advisor who, after reviewing the complete application along with the student's transcript(s), will make a determination about admission to the Honors Program.\nA successful application allows the student to pursue the Honors Thesis Project. Honors is officially granted only when the student's two readers approve the completed thesis.\n### **Requirements**\nStudents pursuing honors in French Studies take a minimum of eleven courses. In addition to the standard requirement of ten courses, FREN 1990 (Senior Thesis) is to be taken in either or both semesters of the student’s senior year. This independent study is designed for the student to devote time to thesis research and writing under the supervision of a thesis advisor.\nThe student is expected to work in close consultation with his/her thesis advisor and to respect deadlines for completion of the outline, drafts, and the final version of the thesis, which at the latest must be submitted by the end of the week after Spring Recess (see deadlines below). It is expected that the student and the thesis advisor will establish a schedule and meet on a regular basis through the entire year. (Meetings once every two weeks on average, particularly during the spring semester, are encouraged). The second reader may or may not be from the Department of French and Francophone Studies, and may be consulted less frequently during the earlier stages of the research/writing, according to their availability and the student’s needs. However, the student is expected to share at least one advanced draft with the second reader before the final submission. \nThe final complete version of the thesis must be submitted by **April 16**(or whichever weekday falls closest to that date). Students should submit one copy to each reader and one electronic **and** one hard copy of the thesis to the Concentration advisor. \n**Work submitted after the final submission deadline will not be accepted for Honors.** In such cases, a grade will be given for the Senior Thesis course, but Honors cannot be awarded. \n### **The Senior Thesis**\nTheses ordinarily range from 50 to 80 pages and are written in French. Topics, approach, and precise calendar of work should be decided in close consultation with the thesis advisor. Students are encouraged to consult previous French Honors theses to get a sense of the range of projects that are possible. At every stage of their research and writing, students are expected to adhere rigorously to [Brown University’s Academic Code]( which may be consulted online.\n**The Research Essay:** The thesis is usually a research-based essay dealing with primary sources (literary works, historical archives, etc.) consulted and cited in the original French. A meritorious Honors thesis will be written in competent and precise language and evince meaningful internal structure and coherence. It will formulate precisely its framing questions and provide textual support for its propositions while making clear their furthest stakes. While students are encouraged to cultivate the originality of their own questions or perspectives, they are also expected to be in productive dialogue with scholarship in the field. Accordingly, to be awarded Honors, a thesis will demonstrate a consistent citation style and clear and correct attribution of all terms and ideas not the student’s own.\n**The Translation Thesis:** Students may alternatively choose to undertake for their Honors thesis a work of translation. This choice must be made with prudence and in close consultation with the thesis advisor, so that there is agreement on the difficulty level of the chosen text, the argument for translating it, and expected standards of ambitiousness and precision in the translation. Usually the translation will be from French to English, though the case may be made on the rare occasion for translation from English to French. Students may choose to translate a whole work, select excerpts, or a series of texts (as in the case of poems or shorter narratives). In all cases, a translation thesis must, to qualify for French Honors, include a critical introduction or preface (a minimum of 10 pages) in which the translator demonstrates advanced knowledge of the place of the chosen text in its original cultural and literary context, engages reasonably with scholarship pertaining to the original text, and shows a mature understanding of the stakes and debates of translation as a practice.\n**The Creative Project:** Some students may elect to undertake for their Honors project a creative work. This decision must be made in close consultation with the thesis advisor, so that there is agreement on the level of ambition and interest of such a project. The creative thesis may be a narrative, poetic, theatrical or experimental/hybrid text. Written in French, it is expected to involve a reading- or research-based dimension. In other words, the creative work will demonstrate meaningful engagement with analogous work in the French/Francophone context, and the pursuit of a certain scholarly intention through creative means—whether to advance knowledge or examination of a certain topic, to experiment with the formal means by which to express or explore a certain issue, or to creatively rewrite an existing work with a view to questioning it or investing it with new meanings. As with the translation thesis, a creative thesis must, to qualify for Honors, include a critical introduction or preface (a minimum of 10 pages) in which the author discusses, in informed and articulate terms, the cultural, literary and/or critical stakes of the project: its intentions, its context and background, its formal choices.\nHonors students will be invited to present their work to members of the Department and fellow and potential French concentrators at the end of term sometime after the April final submission date.\n### **Calendar of Deadlines:**\nPrecise details regarding deadlines and nature/length of submissions must be established clearly between the student and his/her advisor. Suggested deadlines for major stages are as follows:\n· Submission of Applications to Honors Program **- - September 26**\n· Rough outline of thesis due to thesis advisor by**the first week of November**\n· First portion of written work due to thesis advisor (**minimum of 20 pages)** by**mid-December**\n· Submission of full draft to both readers by**March 10**\n· **Completed thesis** submitted to both readers by **April 16**",
  "lita": "# Literary Arts\n\nBrown’s Department in Literary Arts provides a home for innovative writers of fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, literary translation, digital/cross-disciplonary and mixed media. The concentration allows student writers to develop their skills in one or more genres while deepening their understanding of the craft of writing. Many courses in this concentration require a writing sample; students should consult a concentration advisor or the concentration website for strategies on getting into the appropriate course(s).\nCandidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in Literary Arts will be expected to complete the following course work:\n1. At least four writing workshops from among the following series: [LITR 0100A]( \"LITR 0100A\"),[LITR 0100B]( \"LITR 0100B\"), [LITR 0110A]( \"LITR 0110A\"), [LITR 0110B]( \"LITR 0110B\"), [LITR 0110D]( \"LITR 0110D\"), [LITR 0110E]( \"LITR 0110E\"), LITR 011oH the various courses under LITR 0210, LITR 0310/0311, LITR 0610, LITR 1010, LITR 1110, LITR 1150/1151/1152 and LITR 1410 . At least two genres must be covered within the four workshops taken. An independent study in literary arts ([LITR 1310]( \"LITR 1310\") and LITR 1510) may count toward the workshop requirement. Other writing-intensive courses may also count, at the discretion of the advisor.\n2. Six elective reading and research in literary arts courses, which must include:\n  * a course in literary theory or the history of literary criticism\n  * a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created before 1800\n  * a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created before 1900\n  * a course that primarily covers readings and research in literary arts created after 1900\n\nThese courses, selected in consultation with a concentration advisor, may come from (but are not limited to) the following departments: Africana Studies, American Civilization, Classics, Comparative Literature, East Asian Studies, Egyptology, French Studies, German Studies, Hispanic Studies, Italian Studies, Judaic Studies, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures in English, Middle East Studies, Modern Culture and Media, Music, Portuguese and Brazilian Studies, Slavic Studies, South Asian Studies, Theatre, Speech and Dance, Visual Arts. With approval from the concentration advisor, courses covering pre-20th century time periods may be distributed in a variant manner, so long as they cover two distinct literary time periods that precede the 20th century\n3. Among the ten required courses, at least four must be at the 1000-level or above. At least six classes (workshops and reading/research courses) that shall count toward the concentration must be taken at Brown through the Literary Arts Department; up to one of the six LITR courses may be a course taken in another department but cross-listed by Literary Arts. No more than two of the ten required courses for the concentration may also count toward fulfilling a second concentration.\n4. During the senior year, all students must take at least one course within the Literary Arts course offerings (courses with LITR designation by the Registrar, or courses approved by the concentration advisor).\nHonors in Creative Writing: Course requirements are the same as those for the regular concentration (four workshops, six elective literature-reading courses), with the following changes and additions: honors candidates must include two 1000-level workshops or independent studies among their courses; and complete a thesis. Students in their seventh semester who are enrolled in or have completed at least one 1000-level workshop (or independent study) may submit honors applications to the Literary Arts Department from the first day of the fall semester to 25 September; and from 1 through 25 February in the spring. Interested students should obtain information from the office of the Literary Arts Department.\nHonors in Literary Arts Production: Course requirements are the same as those for the regular concentration (four workshop, six literature-reading courses), with the following changes and additions: honors candidates must include two 1000-level workshops, production courses or related independent studies among their courses; and complete a production capstone project. Students in their seventh semester who are enrolled in or have completed at least one 1000-level workshop, production course or independent study, may submit honors applications to the Literary Arts Department from the first day of the fall semester to 25 September; and from 1 through 25 February in the spring. Interested students should obtain information form the Literary Arts Department.",
  "juds": "# Judaic Studies\n\nJews have lived and flourished over thousands of years in a variety of social contexts, stretching from the Land of Israel and the eastern Mediterranean to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Concentrators will have the opportunity to study Jews in these contexts, getting to know their social structures, and what they have created. The subjects of study cover an astonishing range, including history and society, Jewish law and philosophy, and Jewish literature and ritual. Students will learn to unlock this wealth in both the ancient and the modern worlds through a number of academic disciplines - History, Religious Studies, and Literature. These also provide tools for studying and analyzing human societies and cultures in general, for which Jewish experiences provide an important perspective.\n### Program in Judaic Studies\n**Required Coursework**\nA concentration in Judaic Studies includes the following requirements:\n  1. All students are required to take a total of _10 courses_ that count toward the concentration.\n  2. All students must take one full year of modern Hebrew (two of the 10 required courses for the concentration) or fulfill the Hebrew requirement through examination. Usually, the Hebrew requirement is fulfilled by taking [HEBR 0100]( \"HEBR 0100\") and [HEBR 0200]( \"HEBR 0200\"). Fulfillment of the Hebrew requirement through examination does not reduce the total number of 10 courses required for the concentration.\n  3. Students choosing to continue with Hebrew language study may count up to two additional Hebrew courses ([HEBR 0300]( \"HEBR 0300\"), [HEBR 0400]( \"HEBR 0400\"), or [HEBR 0500]( \"HEBR 0500\")) toward fulfillment of the concentration requirements. [HEBR 0600]( \"HEBR 0600\") is counted as a regular, non-language course for the purposes of fulfilling concentration requirements.\n  4. Of the courses required for a concentration in Judaic Studies, students must fulfill both a historical and a methodological breadth requirement. For example, students primarily studying ancient Judaism must enroll in at least one course in medieval or modern Judaism, and students studying primarily modern Judaism must enroll in at least one class focusing on the ancient or medieval period. In addition, at least one course should offer training in a discipline different from the student’s primary disciplinary interest (e.g., a student whose main interest is Jewish history will take at least one course in Jewish thought, literature or religion). These two breadth requirements ensure that the student gains a broader perspective on Judaic Studies as an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary field of study concerned with Jews and Judaism over three millennia of history.\n  5. Subject to the approval of the concentration adviser, up to two courses outside of Judaic Studies that relate directly to the concentration may be counted toward the concentration (e.g., a course on a particular historical context, in a particular discipline, or on a relevant topic, including courses taken abroad that are approved by Brown for transfer credit).\n  6. After consultation with the concentration adviser, each senior concentrator who is not writing a senior thesis in Judaic Studies to fulfill the capstone requirement will designate an advanced course (1000 level) in Judaic Studies as that student’s capstone course. Alternatively, seniors may choose to do an independent study with a Judaic Studies faculty member that will function as the capstone course. Within the context of the capstone course, the student will conduct independent research and write a substantial paper of 20-25 pages on a topic in Judaic Studies that displays in an appropriate way the theoretical and methodological approaches, as well as the interpretive issues, most of interest to the student, thereby engaging the student’s particular disciplinary focus/foci in a serious and substantive way. The student, in consultation with the capstone instructor, will complete the capstone form by the end of the second week of classes of the semester during which the capstone will be undertaken and submit the form to the concentration adviser for final approval. The form includes questions about the capstone course, the topic of the paper, the disciplinary approach(es) the student intends to utilize, and how the paper will fulfill the goals of the capstone. The capstone is an opportunity for students to hone their writing skills, to enhance their ability to undertake independent research, to learn more about and experience Judaic Studies as an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary field, to make well-considered choices with regard to the topic or problem to be examined and the disciplinary approach(es) to be utilized, and to make use of language skills where appropriate. \n  7. Double concentrators may count up to two courses that deal with Jewish history, society, culture or religion that they have used to complete the requirements of their other concentration toward their Judaic Studies concentration.\n  8. Each student who opts to write a senior thesis to fulfill the capstone requirement will approach a potential thesis adviser in Judaic Studies before the end of the second semester of the junior year and secure that faculty member’s agreement to advise the thesis. The thesis will be written over two semesters during the senior year and constitute two of the 10 required courses for the concentration. By the end of the second week of classes of the senior year, the student will present the concentration adviser with a succinct thesis plan approved by the thesis adviser. The second reader of each thesis will be chosen by the concentrator in consultation with the thesis adviser before the end of September of the senior year. Once the second reader has agreed to participate, the second reader will read a draft of each chapter of the thesis and provide feedback after it has been approved by the thesis adviser. In no case will the second reader be invited to participate after the thesis has been completed.\n  9. Study Abroad or Elsewhere in the US: Students who study at other institutions, either in the United States or abroad, may apply up to two topical courses (non-language study) toward completion of the concentration’s requirements as long as Brown approves the courses for transfer credit. These approved courses will count as the two courses taken outside Judaic Studies. Students who study in Israel are required to enroll in a one month Summer/Winter Ulpan (a Hebrew language and cultural immersion course) prior to the beginning of the semester as well as a Hebrew language course during their semester in Israel. Students will receive one transfer credit toward the concentration for both of these language courses combined. Students whose level of proficiency allows them to enroll in a university course conducted in Hebrew are exempt from the Ulpan requirement.\n\n_**Student Goals**_\nStudents in this concentration will:\n  * Have an opportunity to explore aspects of the history, culture, literature, religion, politics, thought and societies of the Jews from ancient times to the present\n  * Acquire at minimum an elementary proficiency in Hebrew\n  * Complete a capstone course or honors thesis\n  * Have an opportunity to explore some of the ways in which more than one discipline contributes to the study of Jews and Judaism through time and space\n  * Have an opportunity to learn about the often complex dynamics characteristic of the interactions of Jews with others in their larger environment as well as the reciprocal influences of Jewish and non-Jewish cultures.\n\n**_Further Information_**\nStudents who are interested in further information about the concentration should contact the Judaic Studies Office at 163 George Street to make an appointment with the undergraduate concentration advisor. [Tel: 401.863.3910] or Judaic@brown.edu.",
  "eveg": "# Environmental Engineering\n\nThe Sc.B. program in Environmental Engineering provides students with the tools to develop sustainable solutions to complicated environmental problems and design real-world solutions that consider risk, sustainability, life-cycle principles, and environmental impacts. Environmental engineers use the principles of engineering, mathematics, biology, and chemistry to develop and implement engineering solutions to protect human health and the environment from the adverse impacts of environmental pollution. Their work includes water and wastewater treatment, air pollution control, soil and groundwater remediation, site characterization and risk assessment, life cycle assessment, and climate change mitigation.\nThe Environmental Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET:  Within a few years of graduation, graduates of the Brown Environmental Engineering (EnvE) Program will: (1) Engage in continued learning through professional development, professional licensure, and service to the profession and society; (2) Achieve leadership positions or roles that advance environmental engineering practice; and (3) Pursue and successfully obtain an advanced graduate or professional degree in environmental engineering or a related discipline. The student outcomes of this program are intended to be those enumerated in items (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of  [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures). In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.)

  "lacs": "# Latin American and Caribbean Studies\n\nThe concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies (LACA) leads to a strong, interdisciplinary understanding of culture, history, and contemporary issues in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Latinx diaspora.\nRequirements are intentionally broad and flexible to accommodate the focused interests of students in understanding the diverse reality of this region. Concentration requirements include four themes: language, area studies, research, and internship or service work. A wide selection of courses from departments across the University expose students to the methods and materials of different disciplines and provide a background in the contemporary and historical contours of Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx societies. For more information, contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Daniel Rodriguez.\n### Concentration Requirements\n**1. Ten courses on Latin American, Caribbean, and/or Latinx subjects.** These may be explicitly designated as LACA classes, but do not need to be. Up to two of these courses can be language learning classes. Relevant courses from study abroad may count toward this total. For double concentrators, up to two classes can count toward the course requirements of both LACA and another concentration. At least two different academic disciplines should be represented in the ten courses. Courses in which the student did substantial work on a Latin American, Caribbean, or Latinx subject may count toward this total, even if the course as a whole has a more general subject matter. Concentrators should periodically update their courses on ASK and confirm with the Director of Undergraduate Studies that they are on track to meeting the coursework requirement. \nThe courses must include at least one survey course providing a comprehensive and comparative view of the region. Examples include the following: \n[LACA 0500]( \"LACA 0500\") | Around Latin America in 80 Days: An Historical and Cultural Journey |   \n---|---|---  \n[LACA 1504G]( \"LACA 1504G\") | Arts of the Environment in the Americas |   \n[LACA 1510I]( \"LACA 1510I\") | Urban Latin America |   \n[LACA 1630]( \"LACA 1630\") | Engaged Humanities: Storytelling in the Americas |   \n[HISP 0730]( \"HISP 0730\") | Encounters: Latin America in Its Literature and Culture  |   \n[HISP 1330Z]( \"HISP 1330Z\") | Tropical Fictions: Geography and Literature in Latin American Culture |   \n[HIST 0234]( \"HIST 0234\") | Modern Latin America  |   \n[HIST 1966Q]( \"HIST 1966Q\") | Colonial Encounters and the Creation of Latin America |   \n[POLS 1210]( \"POLS 1210\") | Latin American Politics |   \n[POBS 0280]( \"POBS 0280\") | Mapping Food, Eating Meaning, Making Community: A Welcome to the Lusophone world |   \n**2. Competence in a Latin American and/or Caribbean language.** Competence in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Haitian Kreyol, Kaqchikel Maya, etc. may be demonstrated through a departmental test, AP credit, language courses at Brown or elsewhere, study abroad, etc; please contact the concentration advisor to confirm. (If the student’s primary area of study is the Anglophone Caribbean, a field language is not necessary.)\n**3. An internship or volunteer service** , located in the U.S. or overseas, for one semester or one summer. Work completed during study abroad may count toward this requirement. The service work will connect theory to practice, applying scholarly knowledge to social challenges. Students are encouraged to consult with the Swearer Center for Public Service for assistance finding a volunteer placement. Students should also meet with the DUS by the beginning of junior year to discuss their work plan for their service component. Upon completion of the internship or service work, students fill and submit via ASK the Internship, Work or Volunteer Service Form, available online in the LACA Undergraduate Concentration webpage (< In addition they are expected to submit via ASK a short letter from a supervisor confirming the completion of the work. \n**4. A capstone project.** This may be a senior honors thesis or creative project, supervised by a primary advisor and a secondary reader; a non-honors research paper; or a reflective paper about non-academic work (such as service or foreign study) related to Latin America, the Caribbean or the Latinx experience. \nThe project may be completed for honors if the student is eligible (see Honors, below).\nAll concentrators are required to enroll in [LACA 1900]( \"LACA 1900\") during their junior or senior year to complete their Capstone project requirement (capstone project or honors thesis). In addition to this course, students may also elect to enroll in one or two semesters of independent study ([LACA 1990]( \"LACA 1990\"), [LACA 1991]( \"LACA 1991\")) with their thesis/project advisor. All Honors Candidates are expected to attend the Annual Concentration Research Day and to give a 10-minute oral presentation of their honors thesis project followed by a short Q&A.\n### **Writing Requirement**\nTo satisfy Brown's writing requirement as a LACA concentrator (which must be completed by the end of the 7th semester), students are encouraged to consider courses that have an emphasis on revision and feedback such as the following: \n[LACA 1900]( \"LACA 1900\") | Preparation for Honors and Capstone Projects on Latin American and Caribbean Topics |   \n---|---|---  \n[ETHN 1200D]( \"ETHN 1200D\") | Latinx Literature |   \n[LACA 0500]( \"LACA 0500\") | Around Latin America in 80 Days: An Historical and Cultural Journey |   \n[LACA 1504G]( \"LACA 1504G\") | Arts of the Environment in the Americas |   \n[LACA 1630]( \"LACA 1630\") | Engaged Humanities: Storytelling in the Americas |   \n[COLT 0710I]( \"COLT 0710I\") | New Worlds: Reading Spaces and Places in Colonial Latin America |   \n[HISP 0730]( \"HISP 0730\") | Encounters: Latin America in Its Literature and Culture  |   \n[HIST 0233]( \"HIST 0233\") | Colonial Latin America |   \n[HIST 1977I]( \"HIST 1977I\") | Gender, Race, and Medicine in the Americas |   \n### **Engaged Scholars Program**\nThe concentration also allows students to pursue the [Engaged Scholars Program]( The Engaged Scholars Program (ESP) in Latin American and Caribbean Studies (LACA) is designed for LACA concentrators who are especially interested in making deeper connections between their academic work and local communities in Providence and beyond. Engaged Scholars combine hands-on experiences such as internships, public service, humanitarian, and development work with their academic learning in order to develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, social engagement.\n### Honors\nQualified undergraduates may work towards the A.B. in Latin American and Caribbean Studies with Honors.\n**Requirements to graduate with Honors:**\n  1. Maintenance of at least an A- average in the ten courses counting for the Latin American and Caribbean Studies concentration\n  2. Maintenance of at least a B+ average in all course work at Brown\n  3. Completion of a senior honors thesis or project with a grade of A\n\nGrades of S do not negatively affect the eligibility for honors. \nGraduating seniors with Honors in Latin American and Caribbean Studies are eligible for an award administered by the concentration for Outstanding Senior Thesis or Project.\n**Senior Honors Thesis or Project Timeline:**\nFor Senior-Year Students-\n  * **By the end of sixth semester:** Students fill and submit a one page proposal to the concentration advisor the Honors Thesis Declaration Form available online in the LACA Undergraduate Concentration webpage (< In the form, they are expected to indicate their thesis or project title and short description.

  "indp": "# Independent Concentration\n\nThe Independent Concentration program is for students interested in actively constructing an interdisciplinary concentration, representing a coherent field of study that Brown does not offer and that cannot be studied cohesively within a standard concentration. Such fields may include emerging areas of study in the academy, such as \"Disability Studies\" or \"Educational Neuroscience,\" and broader interdisciplinary areas, such as \"Aesthetics,\" \"Geography,\" or \"Migration Studies.\" The proposal process consists of the following steps: (1) Meeting with the Curricular Resource Center's IC Peer Coordinators or IC Dean; (2) Completing a draft IC Application and soliciting feedback from the Peer Coordinators; (3) Identifying an approved Faculty Sponsor (an advisor) and obtaining a letter of support; and (4) Submitting the application and letter of support by one of the six deadlines during the academic year. Independent Concentration proposals are reviewed and approved by the College Curriculum Council.\nOnce approved, all independent concentrators receive dedicated advising support from their IC Faculty Advisor and the IC Dean. Independent Concentrators must complete a senior capstone. Students interested in pursuing honors should read the IC Honors Thesis Guidelines.",
  "ital": "# Italian Studies\n\nInherently interdisciplinary, the Italian Studies concentration allows students to strengthen their language skills in Italian and deepen their knowledge of Italian literature, history, art, and culture. Most concentrators have some background in Italian language. However, it is possible to concentrate in Italian studies without having studied the language before coming to Brown, although doing so requires an early start. After fulfilling the language requirement by completing up to Italian 0600 (or the equivalent), students enroll in a variety of advanced courses, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the concentration. Junior concentrators often study abroad in the Brown Program in Bologna. All senior concentrators participate in the “senior conference” by delivering brief presentations on academic topics of their choice in Italian Studies. Concentrators might also pursue capstone research, writing, or multimedia projects.\nThe concentration requires that students demonstrate proficiency in the Italian language by completing up to [ITAL 0600]( \"ITAL 0600\") (or the equivalent in Bologna). [ITAL 0400]( \"ITAL 0400\") is the first language course that counts toward the ten required courses for the concentration (except for students who place out of [ITAL 0400]( \"ITAL 0400\"), who will need to complete a total of nine courses). At least four of the ten courses should be taken in Italian.\nITALIAN STUDIES COURSES |   \n---|---  \n[ITAL 0600]( \"ITAL 0600\") | Advanced Italian II |   \n[ITAL 0750]( \"ITAL 0750\") | Truth on Trial: Justice in Italy |   \n[ITAL 0751]( \"ITAL 0751\") | When Leaders Lie: Machiavelli in International Context |   \n[ITAL 0950]( \"ITAL 0950\") | Introduction to Italian Cinema: Italian Film and History |   \n[ITAL 0975]( \"ITAL 0975\") | Let’s Eat, Italy: Italian History and Culture through Food |   \n[ITAL 0981]( \"ITAL 0981\") | When Leaders Lie: Machiavelli in International Context |   \n[ITAL 1000B]( \"ITAL 1000B\") | Reading Recent Italian Fiction |   \n[ITAL 1000D]( \"ITAL 1000D\") | Italian National Identity: Criticisms and Crises |   \n[ITAL 1000E]( \"ITAL 1000E\") | Masterpieces of Italian Cinema - Capolavori del cinema italiano |   \n[ITAL 1010]( \"ITAL 1010\") | Dante in English Translation: Dante's World and the Invention of Modernity |   \n[ITAL 1029]( \"ITAL 1029\") | World Cinema in a Global Context |   \n[ITAL 1030A]( \"ITAL 1030A\") | Fellini |   \n[ITAL 1320]( \"ITAL 1320\") | Great Authors and Works of Italian Renaissance: Ariosto’s Orlando furioso |   \n[ITAL 1340]( \"ITAL 1340\") | The Panorama and 19th-Century Visual Culture |   \n[ITAL 1350A]( \"ITAL 1350A\") | Transmedia Storytelling and the New Italian Epic. |   \n[ITAL 1400B]( \"ITAL 1400B\") | Fascism and Antifascism: Culture and Literature between the Two World Wars |   \n[ITAL 1400D]( \"ITAL 1400D\") | Photography and Literature: Italian Examples of an Uncanny Relationship |   \n[ITAL 1400F]( \"ITAL 1400F\") | Twentieth Century Italian Culture |   \n[ITAL 1400H]( \"ITAL 1400H\") | Early Modern Italy |   \n[ITAL 1400M]( \"ITAL 1400M\") | Giorgio Agamben and Radical Italian Theory |   \n[ITAL 1400P]( \"ITAL 1400P\") | The Southern Question and the Colonial Mediterranean |   \n[ITAL 1420]( \"ITAL 1420\") | Sex and the Cities: Venice, Florence, and Rome, 1450-1800 |   \n[ITAL 1550]( \"ITAL 1550\") | Italian Representations of the Holocaust |   \n[ITAL 1580]( \"ITAL 1580\") | Word, Image and Power in Early Modern Italy |   \n[ITAL 1590]( \"ITAL 1590\") | Word, Media, Power in Modern Italy |   \n[ITAL 1610]( \"ITAL 1610\") | The Divina Commedia: Inferno and Purgatorio |   \n[ITAL 1620]( \"ITAL 1620\") | The Divina Commedia: Dante's Paradiso: Justifying a Cosmos |   \n[ITAL 1920]( \"ITAL 1920\") | Independent Study Project (Undergraduate) |   \n[ITAL 1990]( \"ITAL 1990\") | Senior Conference |   \n[ITAL 2100]( \"ITAL 2100\") | Introduction to Italian Studies |   \n[ITAL 2190B]( \"ITAL 2190B\") | Fascism and Antifascism: Culture and Literature between the Two World Wars |   \n[ITAL 2190G]( \"ITAL 2190G\") | Letteratura Italiana del Novecento |   \n[ITAL 2220]( \"ITAL 2220\") | New Perspectives on Fascism |   \nCOURSES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS |   \n[HIAA 0340]( \"HIAA 0340\") | Roman Art and Architecture: From Julius Caesar to Hadrian |   \n[HIAA 0550]( \"HIAA 0550\") | Painters, Builders, and Bankers in Early Modern Italy  |   \n[HIAA 0560]( \"HIAA 0560\") | Constructing the Eternal City: Popes and Pilgrims in Early Modern Rome |   \n[HIAA 1200D]( \"HIAA 1200D\") | Pompeii |   \n[HIAA 1301]( \"HIAA 1301\") | The Palaces of Ancient Rome |   \n[HIAA 1302]( \"HIAA 1302\") | Women and Families in the Ancient Mediterranean |   \n[HIAA 1303]( \"HIAA 1303\") | Pompeii: Art, Architecture, and Archaeology in the Lost City |   \n[HIAA 1550B]( \"HIAA 1550B\") | Topics in the Early History of Printmaking: Festival and Carnival |   \n[HIAA 1560A]( \"HIAA 1560A\") | Italy and the Mediterranean |   \n[HIAA 1560C]( \"HIAA 1560C\") | Renaissance Venice and the Veneto |   \n[HIAA 1560D]( \"HIAA 1560D\") | Siena from Simone Martini to Beccafumi |   \n[HIAA 1560F]( \"HIAA 1560F\") | Topics in Italian Visual Culture: The Visible City, 1400- 1800 |   \n[HIAA 1600C]( \"HIAA 1600C\") | Italian Baroque Painting and Sculpture |   \n[MUSC 0071]( \"MUSC 0071\") | Opera |   \n### Italian Studies Concentration and the Brown Program in Bologna\nConcentrators who enroll in the Brown in Bologna program should fulfill the requirements according to the following sequence: prior to departure, the student should complete the level of Italian language study required ([ITAL 0300]( \"ITAL 0300\")) and enroll in one of the courses in the four distribution areas -- Italian literature; Italian History; history of Italian art and architecture; film or performance. Upon return from Bologna, the student should enroll in at least one advanced course offered by the department, preferably a course taught in Italian. Any student returning from the Bologna program must enroll in a course above the language level of [ITAL 0600]( \"ITAL 0600\").  \nCredits toward the Italian Studies concentration may also be transferred from the Brown in Bologna Program. Concentrators may count three courses per semester toward the concentration (or six courses total for the year), although the course content must focus on Italy if the student wishes to count the course toward the concentration requirements. Concentrators should consult the concentration advisor to know which courses may or may not transfer as credits toward the concentration.\n### Honors in Italian Studies\nConcentrators are encouraged to expand their understanding of Italian language, history, or culture through independent research that will result in a thesis, a translation, or a multimedia project, developed in consultation with the undergraduate concentration advisor and the individual faculty member who will advise the student’s project. The Honors thesis in Italian Studies is a two-semester thesis. Students who intend to complete an honors project should enroll for the first semester in [ITAL 1920]( \"ITAL 1920\") (Independent Study), and have their project approved by their advisor by October 15. During the second semester, honors students enroll in [ITAL 1990]( \"ITAL 1990\") and continue to work with their advisor to complete the project. [ITAL 1990]( \"ITAL 1990\") does not count as one of the eight courses required for the concentration.\n### Capstone Experiences in Italian Studies\nA Capstone experiences in Italian Studies would consist of a course or project that a student, in consultation with the undergraduate advisor, feels would integrate the various intellectual engagements of this interdisciplinary concentration, and constitute a culminating experience in Italian Studies at Brown. Such experiences are strongly encouraged, and should be arrived at through conversations with the concentration advisor or a professor in the department. This could include the Brown Program in Bologna, typically taken in the Junior year, and/or the honors thesis in the senior year. However, students may also apply early in the Fall or Spring semester of their senior year for permission to designate one of their courses (1000-level or above) a Capstone course. In consultation with the professor, students in Capstone courses complete an independent research, writing, or multimedia project that is well beyond the required assignment for the course. [ITAL 1920]( \"ITAL 1920\") (Independent Study) may also be designated a Capstone course with the permission of the instructor.",
  "math": "# Mathematics\n\nMathematics is a grouping of sciences, including geometry, algebra, and calculus, that study quantity, structure, space, and change. Mathematics concentrators at Brown can explore these concepts through the department’s broad course offerings and flexible concentration requirements. The concentration leads to either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree (the latter is strongly recommended for students interested in pursuing graduate study in mathematics or related fields). Concentrators begin their learning with multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra. Beyond these prerequisites, students take a variety of advanced topics on the 1000 level based on their interests. After sufficient preparation and with permission of the instructor, students may also take courses on the 2000 level. Students also have the option of completing a thesis project.\nConcentrators in mathematics should complete the prerequisites by the end of their sophomore year.  It is strongly recommended that students take [MATH 1010]( \"MATH 1010\") before taking [MATH 1630]( \"MATH 1630\"), (formerly MATH 1130).\nPrerequisites: |   \n---|---  \nMultivariable calculus and linear algebra (choose one of the following sequences): | 2  \n[MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")  \n& [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") | Multivariable Calculus  \nand Linear Algebra |   \n[MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")  \n& [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") | Multivariable Calculus  \nand Linear Algebra With Theory |   \n[MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\")  \n& [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") | Multivariable Calculus (Physics/Engineering)  \nand Linear Algebra |   \n[MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\")  \n& [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") | Multivariable Calculus With Theory  \nand Linear Algebra With Theory |   \nOr the equivalent |   \nProgram: |   \n[MATH 1530]( \"MATH 1530\") | Abstract Algebra | 1  \nFive other 1000- or 2000-level Mathematics courses .

  "mceg": "# Mechanical Engineering\n\nThe Sc.B. program in Mechanical Engineering (ME) has a long tradition of excellence at Brown. ME is one of the most versatile engineering disciplines as it explores a wide range of systems spanning fluids and solids. Students from this concentration learn the science of motion, designing and analyzing systems that shape our world: From high-precision nanomechanical machines to large-scale aerospace systems. At Brown, ME students carve unique paths leveraging computational, analytical, or experimental methodologies with other areas of interest in the spirit of the open curriculum. They become distinguished scholars, engineering innovators, and management leaders.\nThe curriculum in ME is intended to provide students with a broad interdisciplinary foundation complemented by specialized training in mechanical systems and fluid/thermal systems.\nThe Mechanical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, < The Program Educational Objectives of the Mechanical Engineering program are to prepare the graduates: (1) to pursue careers as creative and innovative mechanical engineers in industry or academia; (2) to advance the frontiers of their field; and (3) to discharge their offices in a professional and responsible manner. The student outcomes of this program are the (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the \"ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs\" available online at <\nPlease note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. \n### Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree\n### **Mathematics Requirements**\nAs mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, significant attention is given to early preparation in mathematics in engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with an exploratory advisor. [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")), followed by [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") and [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") offer content like that in [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"), respectively, but the latter courses are highly recommended for future engineering students because they offer more examples of relevance to the field. Students who would prefer, or require, a more introductory level calculus course may start the sequence with [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"). They may then take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the subsequent semester and in that case, would receive engineering concentration credit equivalent to that which they would have received having taken [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") and [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\"). However, students who find that the step up from [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") to [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") is too challenging, have a choice to take [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")) upon completion of [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), but in this case, [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") would not carry engineering concentration credit and the student would then need to take [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) in the sophomore year.\nStudents who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) calculus courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through AP examinations may start the calculus sequence at a higher level than that suggested above. If a student has AP credit and accepts to use it, it then allows the student to place out of [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") (or [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\")). These students should enroll in the appropriate higher-level math course, e.g., [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") (or [MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\")) or possibly [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") (a more theoretical course that covers similar material). Although it is impossible to place out of [MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") or [MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") with AP credit, we recognize that some students enter with an even higher level of preparation. Those students are advised to enroll in [MATH 0520]( \"MATH 0520\") (Linear Algebra), or [MATH 0540]( \"MATH 0540\") (Honors Linear Algebra), and take their second freshman mathematics course at a higher level, for example, [MATH 1460]( \"MATH 1460\") (Complex Analysis), [MATH 1210]( \"MATH 1210\") (Probability), or MATH 1220 (Mathematical Statistics). Alternatively, for some engineering concentrations, this second MATH credit requirement may be satisfied by taking a course from the Applied Mathematics Department, such as [APMA 0350]( \"APMA 0350\") (Applied Ordinary Differential Equations), [APMA 0360]( \"APMA 0360\") (Applied Partial Differential Equations), [APMA 1650]( \"APMA 1650\") (Statistical Inference) or [APMA 1210]( \"APMA 1210\") (Operations Research: Deterministic Models) if one of those courses listed is not taken for two APMA concentration credits. Details regarding the mathematics requirement for each concentration are listed in the corresponding programs.\n### **Advanced Placement**\nCourses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses.\n### **Transfer Credits**\nSome students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures). In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. \nIf the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system ( Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. \nIf the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see < This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. \n### **Substitutions for Required Courses**\nStudents may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher-level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. \n1.

  "phph": "# Physics and Philosophy\n\nThe Physics and Philosophy concentration is for students with a deep interest in physics who do not need to acquire the laboratory and computational skills of a professional physicist. The concentration allows students to grapple with computational problems and deepen their investigation of conceptual and epistemological issues. By the end of the program, concentrators possess an excellent conceptual understanding of the most philosophically interesting physics, relativity and quantum mechanics.\nThis concentration should prepare a student either for graduate study, especially in a history and philosophy of science (HPS) program, or for employment in science education or journalism. Other professions such as law and medicine will look favorably on such concentrators for having versatile interests and being able to master difficult material. The concentration may serve as an excellent preparation for a law school since physics and philosophy both exercise a rigorous approach to problems of immediate relevance to life but at the same time assume two complimentary and sometimes competing viewpoints.\n### Advising\nConcentration advisors from the Departments of Physics and Philosophy will guide students working towards the A.B. degree.\n### Curriculum\nThe curriculum builds around the fields of physics that have had the biggest impact on philosophy, especially Quantum Physics, and the fields of philosophy most relevant for physics, such as Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Physics. It is strongly recommended that students complete at least one relevant history course.\nThere are 11 required courses (5 in Physics, 5 in Philosophy or History, one course in mathematics) and a final project. The choice of the courses is dictated by the following considerations. The field of physics with both deepest philosophical implications and deepest influence on the rest of physics is Quantum Mechanics. Thus, a 1000-level course in Quantum Mechanics or a closely related field such as Statistical Mechanics is indispensable. The second field of physics most relevant for the concentration is Relativity. This field touches upon and serves as a foundation for a broad list of subjects with major philosophical implications of their own, for example: [PHYS 1170]( \"PHYS 1170\"), [PHYS 1280]( \"PHYS 1280\"), [PHYS 1510]( \"PHYS 1510\"), [PHYS 1100]( \"PHYS 1100\").  This requires another 1000-level physics course in the concentration. 1000-level Physics courses cannot be taken without certain preliminary work, most importantly, [PHYS 0470]( \"PHYS 0470\"), which serves as a prerequisite for most higher-level physics courses and which relies in turn on [PHYS 0160]( \"PHYS 0160\") or [PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\"). Another lower-level physics course is necessary for a student to develop familiarity with the tools which have been employed in producing the physics knowledge.\nA natural introduction into philosophy of physics comes from a course in Early Modern Philosophy. To a large extent, Early Modern Philosophy was shaped by scholars who combined interest in philosophy and physics (e.g., Rene Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz). The influence of the XVII century physics revolution on other central figures such as Kant is unquestionable. Early Modern Philosophy sets an intellectual stage for many subsequent developments in the Philosophy of Physics and directly addresses some of the most perplexing issues like the connection (or lack thereof) between physics and religion. The core of the Philosophy requirement involves two courses in Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science. One course in this field would not be sufficient due to its very broad nature. Students are strongly advised to take a relevant History course. This requirement can be substituted by an additional philosophy course to reflect interests of those students who want a deeper background in Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science or have other related interests such as Ancient Natural Philosophy.\nIn addition to the above philosophy courses, [PHIL 0210]( \"PHIL 0210\") (Science, Perception, and Reality) serves as a gateway into the concentration. It may be substituted by other relevant courses such as [PHYS 0100]( \"PHYS 0100\") (Flat Earth to Quantum Uncertainty: On the Nature and Meaning of Scientific Explanation).\nA course in calculus is a prerequisite for most physics and some philosophy classes.\n**Required courses for the A.B. degree are listed below:**\nPhysics Courses |   \n---|---  \nSelect one of the following introductory courses in Modern Physics: | 1  \n[PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\") | Foundations of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics |   \n[PHYS 0160]( \"PHYS 0160\") | Introduction to Relativity, Waves and Quantum Physics |   \nOne course in Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory:  | 1  \n[PHYS 0470]( \"PHYS 0470\") | Electricity and Magnetism |   \nSelect one of the following in Methods of Experimental and Theoretical physics:  | 1  \n[PHYS 0500]( \"PHYS 0500\") | Advanced Classical Mechanics |   \n[PHYS 0560]( \"PHYS 0560\") | Experiments in Modern Physics |   \nSelect one of the following in Quantum Mechanics and its applications | 1  \n[PHYS 1410]( \"PHYS 1410\") | Quantum Mechanics A |   \n[PHYS 1530]( \"PHYS 1530\") | Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics |   \nOne more 1000-level Physics course | 1  \nPhilosophy Courses |   \nSelect one of the following gateway courses: | 1  \n[PHIL 0210]( \"PHIL 0210\") | Early Modern Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 0060]( \"PHIL 0060\") | Modern Science and Human Values |   \n[PHIL 0640]( \"PHIL 0640\") | Logic |   \nSelect one of the following courses in Early Modern Philosophy: | 1  \n[PHIL 0210]( \"PHIL 0210\") | Early Modern Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 1210]( \"PHIL 1210\") | Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Others |   \n[PHIL 1220]( \"PHIL 1220\") | 17th Century Continental Rationalism |   \n[PHIL 1230]( \"PHIL 1230\") | Kant: The Critique of Pure Reason |   \nSelect two of the following courses in Epistemology, Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science: | 2  \n[PHIL 1705]( \"PHIL 1705\") | Epistemology |   \n[PHIL 1735]( \"PHIL 1735\") | Metaphysics |   \n[PHIL 1755]( \"PHIL 1755\") | Philosophy of Science |   \n[PHIL 1775]( \"PHIL 1775\") | Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics |   \n[PHIL 1780]( \"PHIL 1780\") | Time |   \nHistory Courses |   \nSelect one of the following courses in History of Science: 1 | 1  \n[HIST 0522N]( \"HIST 0522N\") | Reason, Revolution and Reaction in Europe |   \n[HIST 1825M]( \"HIST 1825M\") | Science at the Crossroads |   \n[HIST 1976I]( \"HIST 1976I\") | Imperialism and Environmental Change |   \nCalculus |   \nSelect one of the following: | 1  \n[MATH 0180]( \"MATH 0180\") | Multivariable Calculus |   \n[MATH 0200]( \"MATH 0200\") | Multivariable Calculus (Physics/Engineering) |   \n[MATH 0350]( \"MATH 0350\") | Multivariable Calculus With Theory |   \nFinal Project |   \nSelect one of the following: | 1  \n[PHIL 1990]( \"PHIL 1990\") | Independent Studies |   \n[PHYS 1990]( \"PHYS 1990\") | Senior Conference Course |   \nA course from the PHIL 0990 Senior Seminar series |   \nAny graduate seminar in Philosophy |   \nTotal Credits | 12 \n\n1  \n      \nOr one more Philosophy course.\n### Honors\nSeniors wishing to earn honors by presenting a senior honors thesis should consult their concentration advisor during their sixth semester or at the start of the seventh semester concerning procedures and requirements. Students may earn honors by presenting a senior thesis judged to be of honors quality by two readers. In addition to completing the usual nonhonors requirements, the student should also have a grade point average of over 3.4 in physics, philosophy and history of science courses (of which at least five must be taken for a letter grade). Honors theses are usually prepared over a period of two semesters with an advisor from the Department of Physics or the Department of Philosophy.",
  "phys": "# Physics\n\nPhysics is the scientific study of the fundamental principles governing the behavior of matter and the interaction of matter and energy. Mathematics is used to describe fundamental physical principles, the behavior of matter, and the interactions of matter and energy. As the most fundamental of sciences, physics provides a foundation for other scientific fields as well as the underpinnings of modern technology. The Physics department is unique because of the breadth of its faculty expertise and research, and the relatively intimate size of its classes above the introductory level. Physics concentrators may choose to pursue either the A.B. or the more intensive Sc.B. degree. Course work on either path covers a broad base of topics (for example, electricity and magnetism, classical and quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and statistical mechanics). The Sc.B. degree requires additional advanced topics as well as a senior thesis project.\n### Standard concentration for the A.B. degree\nSelect one of the following Series: | 2  \n---|---  \n[PHYS 0030]( \"PHYS 0030\") | Basic Physics A |   \nor [PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\") |  Foundations of Mechanics  \nor [PHYS 0070]( \"PHYS 0070\") |  Analytical Mechanics  \n[PHYS 0040]( \"PHYS 0040\") | Basic Physics B |   \nor [PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\") |  Foundations of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics  \nor [PHYS 0160]( \"PHYS 0160\") |  Introduction to Relativity, Waves and Quantum Physics  \nTake each of the following: | 5  \n[PHYS 0470]( \"PHYS 0470\") | Electricity and Magnetism |   \n[PHYS 0500]( \"PHYS 0500\") | Advanced Classical Mechanics |   \n[PHYS 0560]( \"PHYS 0560\") | Experiments in Modern Physics |   \n[PHYS 1410]( \"PHYS 1410\") | Quantum Mechanics A |   \n[PHYS 1530]( \"PHYS 1530\") | Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics |   \nOne additional 1000-level course or a mathematics course beyond the introductory level. | 1  \nTotal Credits | 8  \n### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nPrerequisites: |   \n---|---  \nSelect one of each: | 2  \n[PHYS 0050]( \"PHYS 0050\") | Foundations of Mechanics |   \nor [PHYS 0070]( \"PHYS 0070\") |  Analytical Mechanics  \n[PHYS 0060]( \"PHYS 0060\") | Foundations of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics |   \nor [PHYS 0160]( \"PHYS 0160\") |  Introduction to Relativity, Waves and Quantum Physics  \nSelect one of the following: | 1  \n[MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") | Single Variable Calculus, Part II (Physics/Engineering) |   \nor [MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") |  Single Variable Calculus, Part I  \nor [MATH 0100]( \"MATH 0100\") |  Single Variable Calculus, Part II  \nProgram: | 8  \n[PHYS 0470]( \"PHYS 0470\") | Electricity and Magnetism |   \n[PHYS 0500]( \"PHYS 0500\") | Advanced Classical Mechanics |   \n[PHYS 0560]( \"PHYS 0560\") | Experiments in Modern Physics |   \n[PHYS 1410]( \"PHYS 1410\") | Quantum Mechanics A |   \n[PHYS 1420]( \"PHYS 1420\") | Quantum Mechanics B |   \n[PHYS 1510]( \"PHYS 1510\") | Advanced Electromagnetic Theory |   \n[PHYS 1530]( \"PHYS 1530\") | Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics |   \n[PHYS 1560]( \"PHYS 1560\") | Modern Physics Laboratory |   \nTake one additional 1000 or 2000 level Physics course or upper level course in related fields of science chosen by the student with the agreement of his or her advisor. | 1  \nFour Mathematics courses beyond [MATH 0190]( \"MATH 0190\") or [0090]( \"MATH 0090\"), [0100]( \"MATH 0100\") including choices from Applied Mathematics 1 | 4  \n[PHYS 1990]( \"PHYS 1990\") | Senior Conference Course 2 | 1  \nTotal Credits | 17 \n\n1  \n      \nIn addition, courses in computer programming are recommended. \n\n2  \n    \nA senior thesis is required.

  "phil": "# Philosophy\n\nThe Philosophy concentration offers courses covering subjects from ethics to the philosophies of science and literature. It also provides survey courses on various periods in the history of philosophy. Concentrators can expect to acquire a broad competence in philosophy itself, including ancient European and early modern philosophy, logic, ethics or political philosophy, and epistemology or metaphysics. The concentration also teaches, and stresses, skills in critical thinking and writing. There is also a related, but separate concentration in physics and philosophy.\n### Standard Concentration \n10 courses total, of which no more than one may be below PHIL 0100, and at least three must be at or above PHIL 0990.\nFive Area Requirements: |   \n---|---  \nOne course in Ancient Philosophy, e.g. | 1  \n[PHIL 0110]( \"PHIL 0110\") | Ancient Greek Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 1110]( \"PHIL 1110\") | Plato |   \n[PHIL 1120]( \"PHIL 1120\") | Aristotle |   \nOne course in Early Modern Philosophy, e.g.  | 1  \n[PHIL 0210]( \"PHIL 0210\") | Early Modern Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 1210]( \"PHIL 1210\") | Locke, Berkeley, Hume and Others |   \n[PHIL 1220]( \"PHIL 1220\") | 17th Century Continental Rationalism |   \n[PHIL 1230]( \"PHIL 1230\") | Kant: The Critique of Pure Reason |   \nOne course in Epistemology or Metaphysics, e.g. | 1  \n[PHIL 1735]( \"PHIL 1735\") | Metaphysics |   \n[PHIL 1705]( \"PHIL 1705\") | Epistemology |   \n[PHIL 1800]( \"PHIL 1800\") | Philosophy of Mind |   \n[PHIL 1850]( \"PHIL 1850\") | Philosophy of Language |   \nOne course in Ethics or Political Philosophy, e.g. | 1  \n[PHIL 0410]( \"PHIL 0410\") | Moral Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 0560]( \"PHIL 0560\") | Political Philosophy |   \n[PHIL 1470]( \"PHIL 1470\") | Ethics in the Novel |   \n[PHIL 1430]( \"PHIL 1430\") | Moral Theories |   \n[PHIL 1440]( \"PHIL 1440\") | The Nature of Morality |   \nOne course in Logic, e.g. | 1  \n[PHIL 0640]( \"PHIL 0640\") | Logic |   \n[PHIL 1630]( \"PHIL 1630\") | Mathematical Logic |   \n[PHIL 1635]( \"PHIL 1635\") | Advanced Deductive Logic |   \nOne Seminar: either an undergraduate seminar from the 099X series, a course numbered 1XXX that is designated as a seminar, or a graduate seminar numbered 2XXX.  | 1  \nFour additional courses | 4  \nTotal Credits | 10  \n### Note:\nUp to two appropriate courses from departments other than Philosophy department may be included among the ten courses required for the Concentration. Appropriate courses must be sufficiently philosophical. Courses listed on the Philosophy XLIST on Courses@Brown will always count; students can petition for other courses to be counted. Courses from other departments may not be counted toward fulfillment of the area requirements.\n### Capstone Requirement\nEvery philosophy concentrator must complete a capstone project. The capstone will be normally be completed in a student’s last undergraduate year, and it should make use of a significant portion of what the student has learned in their undergraduate education, broadly interpreted. There are three options for the capstone course in philosophy:\n  1. A Senior Thesis: A substantial paper, typically about 40-60 pages, that is researched and written over the course of the senior year under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Typically, students writing a thesis will enroll in [PHIL 1995]( \"PHIL 1995\"), Senior Thesis, both semesters. (In order for a student to be permitted to write a Senior Thesis, they must have completed at least six courses in the concentration and have received a grade either of A or of Satisfactory with Distinction in more than half of them.)\n  2. An Independent Study: A one-semester reading course ([PHIL 1990]( \"PHIL 1990\")) under the direction of a faculty advisor, leading to a substantial research paper, typically 15-25 pages.\n  3. A Special Project undertaken in connection with a philosophy course at or above 0990: Examples include a more-in-depth final paper than is otherwise required or a presentation of some of the material to the class, though students are encouraged to make creative proposals, as well. The specific project should be discussed with, and must be approved by, the instructor of the relevant course.\n\nEvery philosophy concentrator must file the Declaration of Capstone Project by the end of shopping period in their final semester. For further details on the Honors Thesis and Capstone Requirement, see \"Senior Capstone\" and \"Senior Thesis\" on the Department's website.\n### Honors Requirements:\nTo qualify for Honors, a student must:\n  1. Have grades of either A or Satisfactory with Distinction in more than half their philosophy courses and any courses from outside the department that they are counting towards the concentration.\n  2. Successfully complete a Senior Thesis that, in the judgment of the advisor and second reader (to be appointed by the Director of Undergraduate Studies), is worthy of an Honors recommendation.",
  "mide": "# Middle East Studies\n\nThe concentration in Middle East Studies (MES) seeks to build a strong, interdisciplinary understanding of historical and contemporary issues within the Middle East, broadly defined. Requirements are intentionally flexible to accommodate the focused interests of students in understanding the diverse dynamics, histories, and societies of this region. A variety of courses from departments across the University, addressing subjects from antiquity to the present day, expose students to methods and materials of different disciplines and help them build a framework for understanding the Middle East in historical and contemporary context. Concentration requirements are structured around four major cornerstones: language, foundational knowledge and methods, multidisciplinary area studies, and research.\nA semester-by-semester roster of courses eligible for MES elective credit can be found on the [Center for Middle East Studies]( website.\nFoundational Course: All MES concentrators are expected to take the following foundational course. The foundational course requirement cannot be fulfilled via independent study, study abroad, or transfer credits.  | 1  \n---|---  \n[HIST 1968A]( \"HIST 1968A\") | Approaches to the Middle East |   \nElectives: Students must take at least five elective courses chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) from among the courses listed by MES as approved electives on its website ( Students may apply up to two Middle Eastern language credits (beyond those that fulfill the language requirement: see below) to the MES electives requirement. To allow for exposure of different disciplinary approaches to the Middle East, students must take at least one course in the humanities (offered within the departments of Archaeology and the Ancient World, Classics, Comparative Literature, History of Art and Architecture, Modern Culture and Media, Philosophy, or Religious Studies) and at least one course in the social sciences (offered within the departments of Anthropology, History, International Relations, Political Science, Sociology, or Urban Studies).

The purpose of the capstone is to synthesize and apply the skills and knowledge that MES concentrators have acquired through the MES curriculum—including disciplinary perspectives, methodological and theoretical approaches, background in the historical and contemporary dynamics of the region, and language competency—to particular interests developed through the concentration. Capstones offer students the opportunity to integrate and build upon their experiences within the concentration, while demonstrating intellectual creativity, research skills, and effective communication, and should serve in some sense as a culmination of or reflection on what one has gained in the concentration. All students are expected to present their capstone research in the final semester before graduation. Presentations of honors theses will be approximately twenty minutes long, and those of non-honors capstone projects will be approximately ten minutes long, both followed by a question-and-answer session. Capstone projects must fulfill the following requirements: | 1  \n• Must be taken in the final two semesters before graduation (excluding summer and winter sessions) |   \n• Must incorporate research in a Middle Eastern language. |   \n• Must be approved or overseen by a MES or MES-affiliated faculty member. |   \n• Must be presented in the final semester before graduation. |   \nCapstones can take one of three forms: |   \na. A Middle East–focused research paper of at least 20 pages for an existing concentration-eligible (MES-coded or X-Listed) course, undertaken with the permission and supervision of the instructor. |   \nb. An independent study or project (artistic, research, or otherwise), approved by the DUS and supervised by at least one faculty member for at least one semester under the [MES 1970]( \"MES 1970\") - Independent Study designation. |   \nc. A two-semester honors thesis, completed under the supervision of a primary reader (who is an MES or MES-affiliated faculty member) and a secondary reader (who can be from other Brown departments and programs), and in coordination with the DUS. 4 |   \nTotal Credits | 11 \n\n1  \n      \nFor concentrators graduating before 2023, courses designated “Foundational Courses” under previous concentration requirements may be used to fulfill this requirement. Please meet with the MES Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) to discuss any such arrangements. \n\n2  \n    \nPreviously HIST 1968 or HIST 1968A: Approaches to the Middle East. Any student who has taken HIST 1968 or HIST 1968A: Approaches to the Middle East, will have fulfilled this requirement. \n\n3  \n    \nConcentrators are encouraged to discuss options for fulfilling language requirements with the DUS. \n\n4  \n    \nTwo semesters of Independent Study ([MES 1970]( \"MES 1970\") & [MES 1971]( \"MES 1971\")) are required for honors and will raise the number of required courses to 13. One of these Independent Study courses should take the form of a thesis writing workshop supervised by the DUS or other designated MES faculty during the first semester of thesis writing. Students must declare their intention to write an honors thesis and submit a thesis prospectus (to include a thesis proposal, research plan, proposed thesis outline, initial literature review, and initial bibliography) by April 25th of their junior year (for May graduates) or November 20th of their junior year (for December graduates). \n\n*\n    \n**Study Abroad**\nConcentrators may apply up to two courses per semester of study abroad toward their MES concentration requirements, with a maximum of four courses (for two semesters abroad). Students must meet with their advisors and have them sign off on their specific course selections prior to embarking upon their program. Study abroad transfer credits may only be applied toward fulfilling elective and language requirements. Study abroad transfer credit may not be used to fulfill foundational course requirements. \n\n**\n    \n**Dual Concentrators**\nMiddle East Studies concentrators may apply up to two courses that fulfill MES concentration requirements toward fulfilling the requirements of another concentration. Language courses do not count toward this two-course limit on overlapping courses.\n### Honors\nStudents may graduate with honors in MES by completing an undergraduate honors thesis in MES. To be eligible for honors, students will have earned an ‘A’ (or 'S' with distinction) in the majority of courses for the concentration and will have submitted a thesis prospectus and secured a faculty advisor by the end of their junior year. Honors theses are substantial research projects driven by a deep interest in engaging with a selected topic of study. They require a time commitment and coordination between students, advisors, and the DUS to ensure completion. Honors students will undertake two semesters of thesis writing in their senior year, the first in a thesis writing workshop ([MES 1971]( \"MES 1971\")) supervised by the DUS or other MES faculty, followed by a second semester of Independent Study ([MES 1970]( \"MES 1970\")) to complete the thesis under the guidance of the thesis advisor. This is typically done during senior year and will raise the total number of required courses to 12.",
  "neur": "# Neuroscience\n\nNeuroscience is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the functions and diseases of the nervous system. It draws on knowledge from neurobiology as well as elements of psychology and cognitive science, and mathematical and physical principles involved in modeling neural systems. Through the Neuroscience concentration, students develop foundational knowledge through courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics as well as three core courses in neuroscience. They are also required to develop facility with research methodologies (through courses in statistics and laboratory methods) before moving into specific topics in the field (e.g., visual physiology, neurochemistry and behavior, and synaptic transmission and plasticity). Members of the Neuroscience faculty are affiliated with the Carney Institute for Brain Science, a multidisciplinary program that promotes collaborative research about the brain. Prospective concentrators should contact neuroundergrad@brown.edu in order to have a faculty advisor assigned to them.\nThe concentration combines a general science background with a number of specific courses devoted to the cellular, molecular, and integrative functions of the nervous system. The concentration allows considerable flexibility for students to tailor a program to their individual interests. Elective courses focus on a variety of areas including molecular mechanisms, cellular function, sensory and motor systems, neuropharmacology, learning and memory, animal behavior, cognitive function, bioengineering, theoretical neuroscience and computer modeling. \nYou may find this following form useful for mapping out your courses, be sure to use it before meeting with your concentration advisor for the first time: [[link to course plan worksheet PDF](\n### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nThe concentration in neuroscience leads to an Sc.B. degree.

This is a chance for the student to explore and apply the concepts that they have learned in their concentration courses. The following are ways in which this research requirement can be met. After consulting with your concentration advisor, be sure to include how you will fulfill your research requirement in the appropriate box within ASK: 1. Enrolling in independent study courses ([NEUR 1970]( \"NEUR 1970\"), CLPS 1970/80 or BIO 1950/60) for work in a lab. Keep in mind to count this towards your concentration two semesters or one semester and a summer are required. 2. Enrolling in independent study ([NEUR 1970]( \"NEUR 1970\")) to work with a faculty member to explore an integrative topic related to neuroscience. See our section on independent study for more information. 3. Enrolling in a course-based research experience, also known as a CURE course. Current related CURE courses are [NEUR 1630]( \"NEUR 1630\"), CLPS 1195, CLPS 1591, but there might be new ones coming down the pipeline. 4. Participating in a structured summer research program (eg. an UTRA or an REU) that is equivalent in scope and scale as would be pursued during a semester of independent research. 5. Participating in a research-focused Fall or Spring UTRA. 6. Pursue a design or independent research project related to neuroscience that could be associated with a different course. 7. Anyone writing an honors thesis automatically fulfils the research requirement, in order to document your research requirement, please describe your plan in your Course Plan Worksheet and in ASK, be sure to discuss it with your concentration advisor to make sure it is appropriate.

  "mcmd": "# Modern Culture and Media\n\nModern Culture and Media (MCM) is an interdisciplinary concentration that explores the ties between media and broader cultural and social formations. We stress creative thinking and critical production: comparative analysis and theoretical reflection, as well as work that integrates practice and theory. We thus bring together aspects of modern culture that are normally separated by departmental structures such as film and media studies, fine art, literature, literary arts and philosophy. This concentration offers the student a range of possible specializations. A student might decide to focus on the critical study and production of a certain type or combination of media (print, photography, sound recording, cinema, video, television, and digital media); or they might focus on certain cultural, theoretical and/or social formations (for example, gender/sexuality in post-Cold war television, postcolonial theory and film, the changing form of the novel, theories of subjectivity and ideology, video games and theories of representation). These paths are united by a commitment to critical thinking/practice: rather than reproducing conventions, MCM concentrators learn how conventions emerge, what work they do, and explore ways to change them.\nTheory Based concentrators may choose to study a particular historical moment, a medium, or a mode of textual production, in combination with theoretical studies that examine the categories of cultural analysis: for example, the distinction between high and low culture. Examples of areas of interest include but are not limited to film, gender/sexuality, digital media, television, post-coloniality, the novel, modern thought, the modern arts, sound, and theories of ideology and subjectivity. Productive work in some modern medium or textual mode is encouraged for all concentrators. MCM’s approach to production recognizes the inextricable link between theory and practice, and the possibility of a fruitful complicity between them. Production, in the sense defined here, is a theoretically informed sphere or practice, one within which acknowledged forms of cultural creation are tested and extended in close complementarity with the analyses conducted elsewhere in MCM.\nThe Practice Based concentration combines production courses with the critical study of the cultural role of practice. It aims to engage students in the analysis of theories of production elaborated within philosophical, artistic, and technological traditions, while encouraging them to produce works that interrogate these traditions.\n### Theory Based\nTheory Based consists of 11 courses.\nCore courses |   \n---|---  \n[MCM 0150]( \"MCM 0150\") | Text/Media/Culture: Theories of Modern Culture and Media | 1  \nSelect two of the following: 1 | 2  \n[MCM 0220]( \"MCM 0220\") | Print Cultures: Textuality and the History of Books |   \n[MCM 0230]( \"MCM 0230\") | Digital Media |   \n[MCM 0240]( \"MCM 0240\") | Television Studies |   \n[MCM 0250]( \"MCM 0250\") | Visuality and Visual Theories |   \n[MCM 0260]( \"MCM 0260\") | Cinematic Coding and Narrativity |   \n[MCM 1110]( \"MCM 1110\") | The Theory of the Sign |   \nAdditional courses | 5  \nOne must be an upper level course from the MCM 1200 series |   \nTwo must be senior seminars from the MCM 1500 or MCM 1700 series |   \nTwo must be at any level in MCM above [MCM 0260]( \"MCM 0260\") |   \nThree additional courses.

Focus Area: Of the 11 courses required for the concentration, at least 3 courses must be in a focus area approved by a concentration advisor. These courses may be MCM courses, related courses, or a combination of the two, and they must represent a focus on some aspect of modern literature, theory, media, art or culture. Examples of possible focus areas are: mass/popular culture, gender/sexuality, language/representation/subjectivity, narrative, digital media, film, modern thought, television, the modern arts, the novel, colonialism and post-colonialism. This is **not** an exhaustive list. Production courses may be in the focus area but must be in addition to the minimum 3 courses.\n  2. Production: Work in production is encouraged but not required for Theory Based concentrators. Of the 11 courses required for concentration, as many as 3 may be in production. These may be production courses offered by MCM (film, video, digital media) or courses in creative writing, painting, photography, journalism, etc., provided they do not bring the total number of concentration courses taken outside MCM to more than 3.\n\n### Practice Based\nPractice Based consists of 11 courses:\nTwo core courses: |   \n---|---  \n[MCM 0150]( \"MCM 0150\") | Text/Media/Culture: Theories of Modern Culture and Media | 1  \nSelect one MCM Introductory Practice course (MCM0700 series).

This list is not exhaustive.\nThe honors program in MCM is designed for students who wish to integrate their skills in a special project. Students who qualify for Honors in the Theory Based track are eligible to apply to do an Honors project or thesis. Students should submit a letter of intent in their 6th semester, and a formal proposal by the first day of their 7th semester. Applications will be screened by the MCM Honors Committee. (Application forms are available in the MCM office.) If approved, a student must then register for [MCM 1980]( \"MCM 1980\") (taken in the 7th semester), a one-credit course which can count towards their Focus Area requirements, and [MCM 1990]( \"MCM 1990\") (taken in the 8th semester), a one-credit thesis course in which they complete the Honors project/thesis.",
  "mdvc": "# Medieval Cultures\n\nThe program in Medieval Studies offers a concentration in Medieval Cultures with two tracks with distinct foci: one in Medieval Cultures and the other in Late Antique Cultures. Medieval Cultures focuses on the 6th-15th centuries, combining interdisciplinary perspectives with in-depth study of one or two related disciplines.\nLate Antique Cultures deals with the 3rd-9th centuries, when ancient cultural forms were still in place but medieval cultures were beginning to take shape simultaneously. The first undergraduate degree of its kind in this country, Late Antique Cultures studies the changing relation of cultural practices, social patterns, political and economics forms, and artistic and literary traditions in this imporant transition period.\nA traditional area of study in Medieval Cultures is Western Europe in the High Middle Ages, but students are encouraged to work comparatively in Byzantine, Islamic, Judaic and/or Slavic cultures in the middle ages.\n### Medieval Cultures Track\nIt is recommended that prospective concentrators take the introductory course, Medieval Perspectives, during their freshman or sophomore year.\n### Requirements\nTen courses approved by the Program in Medieval Studies, including two courses in medieval history and one 1000- or 2000-level course that uses primary texts in a medieval language other than Middle English. Interested students are invited to discuss their plans with an appropriate faculty member of the Program. A concentration proposal should be prepared in consultation with the faculty advisor and submitted to the Program Chair for approval.\n[JUDS 0050M]( \"JUDS 0050M\") | Difficult Relations?

honors thesis in addition to completing the required courses of the concentration. The thesis permits the student to synthesize various disciplines or interests, or to pursue a new interest in greater depth. To be eligible for Honors, candidates must complete a minimum of six approved courses in Medieval Studies by the end of their third year with more grades of A than B. Students should apply for admission to Honors and should meet with their faculty advisor(s) no later than spring of the junior year to plan the thesis project. Accepted candidates write the thesis in a two-semester course sequence under the supervision of a director and second reader drawn from the Medieval Studies faculty.\nInterested students should contact the concentration advisor for further details or consultation (863-1994).\n### Late Antique Cultures Track\nOne course in Roman history: | 1  \n---|---  \n[CLAS 1310]( \"CLAS 1310\") | Roman History I: The Rise and Fall of an Imperial Republic |   \n[CLAS 1320]( \"CLAS 1320\") | Roman History II: The Roman Empire and Its Impact (recommended) |   \nOne class in medieval history | 1  \nOne course at the advanced level (numbered at least 1000) in one approved language 1 | 1  \nSix other courses drawn from appropriate offerings and with the approval of the concentration advisor.

  "musc": "# Music\n\nThe concentration in Music integrates theory, history, ethnomusicology, technology, composition, and performance. Upon completing two foundational courses in theory and musicianship, concentrators have the flexibility to craft an intellectual pathway based on their particular interests and goals. The curriculum is supported by the Orwig Music Library, a state-of-the-art facility with holdings of over 40,000 books and scores and an equal number of sound and video recordings. Concentrators are encouraged to participate in one or more of the departmentally sponsored performing organizations: Chorus, Orchestra, Jazz Band, Wind Symphony, Chamber Music Performance, Electroacoustic Ensemble, Old-time String Band, Javanese Gamelan, or Ghanaian Drumming.\n### Concentrating in Music\nIf you choose Music as a Concentration*, you will be expected to achieve well-rounded training as a musician, regardless of the genre(s) in which you specialize. This training is manifested in the following general components:  \n**Fundamental skills** are important for any musician, and therefore a minimum of two music theory/musicianship courses are required of all students who wish to Concentrate. Students have the opportunity to enter into various theory courses according to their interest and experience.  \n**Historical and cultural knowledge** of music is another key area from which Concentrators are required to complete courses. These courses may be studies of Western or non-Western forms of music.  \n**The creation of music** is also central to the Music Concentration. Students are encouraged to make music in a number of ways, including participation in ensembles, solo performance, composition, music production, and/or conducting.  \nMusic faculty will be available to advise students on shaping the flexible parts of their Concentration and achieving their goal at Brown.\n**Concentration Requirements:**\n**Music Theory**\n  * Two courses in music theory, which may include one 400-level and one 500-level course, or two 500-level courses.\n\n[MUSC 0400A]( \"MUSC 0400A\") | Introduction to Music Theory | 1  \n---|---|---  \n[MUSC 0400B]( \"MUSC 0400B\") | Introduction to Popular Music Theory and Songwriting | 1  \n[MUSC 0550]( \"MUSC 0550\") | Theory of Tonal Music I | 1  \n[MUSC 0560]( \"MUSC 0560\") | Theory of Tonal Music II | 1  \n[MUSC 0570]( \"MUSC 0570\") | Jazz and Pop Harmony | 1  \n**Music Scholarship, Production and Advanced Theory**\nA minimum of four upper-level courses above 1000, must include:\n  * One upper-level course in musicology or ethnomusicology\n  * Any three upper-level courses, including graduate-level courses\n\n**Additional Electives (according to student interest)**\nFour additional elective courses, may include:\n  * Up to four half-credit courses in performance - AMP music instruction and/or Ensemble Participation (2 credits)\n  * Up to two courses outside of the department\n  * One music course below the 100 level\n\n**Senior Project**\nAll music concentrators will choose a culminating experience for their senior year, either a capstone project or honors project. This may take the form of a performance, scholarly study, or original creative work. All students will have a primary advisor for their Senior Project. The work may be done independently of a course for credit, as an independent study, or within the framework of an existing course.\n**Additional Notes**  \nAll concentration substitutions and/or exceptions must be approved by the concentration advisor in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. A substitution or exception is not approved until specified in writing in the student’s concentration file in ASK.\n### Honors in Music (optional)\nFaculty Rules stipulate “Brown University shall, at graduation, grant honors to students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstrated superior quality and culminated in an honors thesis of distinction.”\nIn order to apply for Honors in Music, at least half of the student's coursework in Music must be As or Ss with Distinction. Please note that Brown's transcripts do not indicate whether a student receives distinction in a S/NC course. (\"S*\" indicates that a course is mandatory S/NC.) This information must be obtained from the course instructor or the Registrar's Office.\n**Departmental Procedures:**\nThe Department welcomes a variety of projects leading to Honors in Music. Theses in Music may involve research in musicology, ethnomusicology, or theory; performance; composition, computer music, studio production, or instrument design; or combinations of the preceding categories. Creative and performance projects should be accompanied by pertinent research and/or documentation. Students are encouraged to meet with prospective honors committee members in the junior year to craft a thesis project that is appropriate in scope.\n_NOTE: the term HONORS COMMITTEE refers to a student’s honors thesis advisor and readers._\nA student wishing to propose a project should proceed as follows:\n  1. An honors candidate must secure a faculty advisor and a second reader to serve as an honors committee during the third to last (typically sixth) semester. A [declaration of intent]( (Brown login required), consisting of a brief description of the proposed honors project and the names of the committee members, must be submitted to the Director of Undergraduate Studies by the last day of reading period in the third to last semester. \n  2. At the beginning of the penultimate (typically seventh) semester the student will submit a formal proposal describing the project to the honors committee for approval. Examples of recent honors proposals are [available here]( (Brown login required). The proposal must receive committee approval and be given to the department's Academic Student Affairs Coordinator for distribution to the full faculty by the first day of the first full week of classes of the semester. The department faculty will vote on the proposals at the next regularly scheduled meeting. Decisions will be based on the student’s overall performance in music courses and on the quality of the proposal. The advisor will notify the student of the faculty’s decision.\n  3. It is expected that honors projects will normally take two semesters to complete. Students pursuing honors may choose to register for [MUSC 1970]( \"MUSC 1970\") in the Fall and/or in the Spring. If not enrolled in an independent study, the student should meet with the advisor at the beginning of the semester to make a plan for regular meetings. The student is advised to meet with the secondary reader at least twice each semester before the thesis is formally submitted. By finals week of the penultimate semester, honors candidates must demonstrate substantial progress by submitting to the honors committee a partial draft of a paper or composition or, for performance projects, by playing a significant portion of the programmed repertoire. Failure to make sufficient progress may result in the termination of the honors project.\n  4. Last semester deadlines: Honors candidates must submit a complete draft to their honors committee by the first day of classes following the eighth week of the last semester. The committee will comment on the project and suggest revisions. Revisions must be completed, and the final project submitted to the honors committee by the first day of classes two weeks later. In the case of performance projects, this means that both the public performance and the scholarly component must have been completed by this date. In the case of research projects, all figures, notes, bibliography, and other critical apparatus must have been completed. Failure to make the deadline may result in the forfeiting of honors by the candidate, though the student may complete the project as a capstone project.\n  5. The honors committee will confer to determine their views on their projects. If the second reader is outside Music, the advisor may solicit a written recommendation about the merits of the project.\n  6. The advisor will deliver a copy of the completed thesis to the department's Academic Student Affairs Coordinator by the middle of the eleventh week of the last semester so that it may be made available for review by the full faculty.\n  7. During the twelfth week of the last semester, the advisor will report on the project at a meeting of the Department faculty for a vote. The advisor will notify the student of the faculty’s decision.\n  8. Honors recipients will present their projects at a Department of Music Convocation held once annually during reading period in the Spring Semester.",
  "nais": "# Critical Native American and Indigenous Studies\n\nCritical Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS) is an interdisciplinary concentration offered through the American Studies department focused on research, teaching and engagement with the social, cultural, artistic, ancestral, heritage, legal and political aspects of Native American and Indigenous peoples in the historical and contemporary periods. It emphasizes the integrated study of indigeneity within contemporary U.S. borders, also extending across the Americas, to Oceania and to other parts of the world. This concentration builds on Brown University’s strengths and history of engagement with critical theory, studies and pedagogy, and with topics of social justice, inequality, power structures and structural violence. Through courses across four breadth areas (Creative Expressions; History, Politics and Policy Issues; Language and Identity; Systems of Knowledge and Belief: Fundamentals of Indigenous Living, Society and Wellness) and including foundational and capstone courses, concentrators explore topics and research projects focused on further supporting the interests, concerns and needs of Indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere and globally.\nThis critical approach is also grounded in Indigenous-centered knowledge production, in addition to engagement with topics such as: decolonial scholarship and practices (and the further defining of those terms); Indigenous self-determination and political and social justice; Indigenous activism and sovereignty struggles; the politics of land, dispossession and heritage studies; critiques of racial capitalism and extractive economies; issues of policing, incarceration, criminalization and violence against women; environmental justice and global environmental change; health and economic disparities; structural racism; language loss; cultural and intellectual property rights; and human rights advocacy.\nProspective concentrators should visit the [Native American and Indigenous Studies website]( to learn more about the concentration and associated faculty, courses and affiliated staff.\nTo declare the Critical Native American and Indigenous Studies concentration, visit [Advising Sidekick](\nContact Mack Scott (mack_scott@brown.edu) for additional information and advising. Dr. Scott serves as the CNAIS Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS).\n### Requirements \n[ETHN 1200K]( \"ETHN 1200K\") | Introduction to Native American and Indigenous Studies | 1  \n---|---|---  \nFour (4) courses at the 1000-level related to a focus area of study (determined by the student, in consultation with the NAIS DUS and faculty advisor), also serving to prepare for the capstone requirement; these courses may be from different breadth areas. | 4  \nFour (4) Elective Courses from across the Concentration Breadth Areas | 4  \nConcentration breadth areas are: |   \n1) Creative Expressions (Arts, Literature and Language) |   \n2) History, Politics and Policy Issues |   \n3) Language and Identity |   \n4) Systems of Knowledge and Belief: Fundamentals of Indigenous Living, Society and Wellness (Environment, Medicine, Biology, Health, Psychology, Public Health, Philosophy, Religion) |   \nThese courses must be at the 1000-level |   \nAt least two breadth areas must be included in the overall course of study, with a minimum of two courses in a breadth area outside of the focus area of study (if that is connected to only one breadth area); electives provide an opportunity for expansion beyond the focus area. |   \nNo more than two Independent Study Project (ISP or GISP) courses counting towards fulfillment of the concentration. |   \nCourses that are not NAIS designated (in the list of concentration courses) may count toward the concentration if agreed upon by the department faculty advisor and NAIS DUS and closely connected to areas of study. |   \nNAIS 1900 | Critical NAIS Capstone Course | 1  \nTotal Credits | 10  \nDouble Concentrations: Students concentrating in Critical Native American and Indigenous Studies and another discipline may count no more than two courses towards both concentrations.\nTransfer credits: Credits for courses taken at other institutions may be applied to the Critical NAIS concentration following review by the department faculty advisor and the NAIS DUS. No more than four (4) transfer courses can be applied toward this A.B.\n### Language Study:\nThrough a focus on the Language and Identity Breadth Area, students may include one year (two courses) of language study (determined by the student and faculty advisor, which could be met through a DISP or a GISP course). The language may be an Indigenous one but does not need to be; rather, it should align closely with the goals and interests of the concentrator and could contribute to research and learning goals through access to records, manuscripts and other documents not in English. Students not focusing on Language and Identity may also be interested in language study and are encouraged to include that in their Concentration if it contributes to their goals and objectives.\n### Honors Thesis or Project (Optional):\nStudents may choose to complete their Critical NAIS concentration with honors by completing an honors thesis or project, in addition to other course requirements and the 10 credits needed to complete the concentration. To successfully complete Honors in the Critical NAIS concentration, a student must:\n  * outline a viable research project\n  * have the support of at least one faculty advisor\n  * submission and approval of a thesis or project proposal to the faculty advisor and NAIS DUS.\n\n**Thesis Requirements:**\n  * Good academic standing at the University and in the concentration (see below)\n  * Completion of a thesis based on extended independent research under the guidance of a Brown University faculty advisor(s)\n  * Enrollment in two thesis preparation courses (with thesis advisor) over the final year of undergraduate study (in the fall and spring semesters of final year)\n  * Submission of an Honors Thesis/Project outline and application for honors designation within the Critical NAIS concentration (to the NAIS DUS and faculty advisor(s)) at the end of the third year of study or by Sept. 30 of the final year. A final proposal of a five-page, double-spaced project description along with a bibliography of relevant sources should be submitted following approval of the thesis/project outline.\n  * Completed thesis submitted to the NAIS Faculty Director and thesis faculty advisor no later than the third week of April (for May graduation) or the first Monday of December (for winter graduation).\n\n### Academic Requirements:\n  * At least two consecutive semesters in good academic standing at the time of application (submission of honors prospectus)\n  * The Honors Thesis must earn an A (or a recommendation for Honors) from two faculty readers, in addition to fulfilling all other concentration requirements.\n\nIf a student completes an honors thesis that is not conferred honors status, the two semesters of research and writing would constitute completion of the Capstone course (NAIS 1900).",
  "sts": "# Science, Technology, and Society\n\nScience, Technology, and Society (STS, formerly Science and Society) is an interdisciplinary concentration that examines the processes of scientific discovery and the establishment of scientific policies and systems of belief from historical, philosophical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. Concentrators analyze the practices, norms, and values that reflect and shape our deepest convictions about what is considered \"science.\" Students select courses in the physical sciences, life sciences, or mathematics and choose a thematic track that may include the history and philosophy of science; gender and science; race, science and ethnicity; health and medicine; environment and society; or they may create their own independent focus. STS prepares students to follow, guide, and shape scientific knowledge as it travels from the laboratory into the public arena.\n**Requirements**\nConsisting of 12 courses, the program of study outlined below will be developed by each student in consultation with the concentration advisor. Where appropriate, independent reading, lab courses or GISPS may count for up to three of the twelve total courses. Students will take a minimum of 7 intermediate to advanced courses.\n**Required Courses (2)**\nThe concentration has two required courses.\n  * [STS 1000]( \"STS 1000\") : Introduction to Science and Society: Theories and Controversies, or equivalent introductory course: usually taken in the second or third year.\n  * [STS 1900]( \"STS 1900\") : Senior Seminar in Science and Society, also open to non-majors with the proper background, usually taken senior year.\n\n**Thematic Track (3)**\nStudents will organize their course of study around the choice of a thematic track. The theme may be thought of as the applied content portion of the concentration. Students will take a minimum of three courses, at least one of which must be at an advanced level, in one of the thematic areas listed below:\n  * History & Philosophy of Science\n  * Gender & Science\n  * Race, Science & Ethnicity\n  * Health & Medicine\n  * Representing Science in Literature & Culture\n  * Policy, Persuasion & the Rhetoric of Science\n  * Environment & Society\n  * Independent Focus\n\n**Science Track (4)**\nStudents will take a minimum of four courses in one of the following scientific areas: physical sciences, life sciences, mathematics/computer science. The chosen area should provide appropriate background and support for the chosen concentration theme. The science courses will be sequenced such that a concentrator will move enough beyond the introductory level to gain some understanding of the world view of scientists within a chosen field. The particular sequence of courses which best meets the science requirement will be chosen in consultation with the concentration advisor. When necessary, the concentration advisor will seek guidance from faculty within the chosen scientific field.\n**Science and Technology Studies Theory (3)**\nStudents will take three Science and Technology Studies-related courses in the social sciences and humanities. These courses, which will provide critical theoretical background for the study of Science and Society, should address questions of historiography, epistemology and methodology in the field of science and technology studies. A full list of such courses and sample concentrations may be found at <\n**Honors**\nTo qualify for Honors a student must:\n  * Be in good standing\n  * Have completed at least two thirds of the concentration requirements by the application deadline\n  * Have earned a majority of “A” grades in the concentration. Classes taken S/NC will count as qualifying towards that majority if they are marked “S with distinction” or are accompanied by a [Course Performance Report]( indicating that had the student taken the course for a grade, the grade would have been an “A.”",
  "rels": "# Religious Studies\n\nThe concentration in Religious Studies cultivates understanding of societies and cultures throughout the world by exploring religious thought and practice in various historical, geographic, and political contexts. Concentrators discover new ways of engaging the complex world in which they live by studying the public and private concerns that the study of religion highlights, including understandings of self, community, good, evil, authority, and inequality. Equipped with interdisciplinary skills of interpretation and analysis, students learn how political affairs, institutions, conflicts, and social spheres commonly recognized as secular have taken shape through the formation and transmission of religious beliefs, behaviors, values, and rituals. These skills include: close analysis of texts, images, artifacts, artistic works, and other social data; synthesis of research through written and verbal expression; interpretation of the past and present through multiple forms of evidence; and engagement with contemporary social issues and communities.\n### 1. Basic Requirement\nA concentration in Religious Studies includes a minimum of nine semester-long courses. Those nine courses include [RELS 1000]( \"RELS 1000\") (a seminar in theories and methods in the study of religion), [RELS 1995]( \"RELS 1995\") (the senior capstone seminar) and seven other concentration courses, which must satisfy the concentration's distribution requirements. Students who transfer to Brown or study abroad must complete at least five courses in Religious Studies at Brown.\n### **2. Distribution of Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced courses:**\nAmong the seven concentration courses, no more than four courses can be at the introductory level (0001-0199). The plan of study must include at least two advanced-level courses (above 1000), in addition to [RELS 1000]( \"RELS 1000\") and [RELS 1995]( \"RELS 1995\").\n### **3. Distribution of Focus and Approach:**\nConcentrators are encouraged to develop a broad understanding of religious activity as well as a deep understanding of particular forms of religion. A concentrator's course plan should include courses that examine a variety of geographic and cultural contexts, through a variety of approaches. The seven concentration courses (that is, the courses other than [RELS 1000]( \"RELS 1000\") and [RELS 1995]( \"RELS 1995\")) must:\n  1. examine more than one religious tradition or culture;\n  2. reflect more than one primary approach to the study of religion (e.g., philosophical, historical, textual)\n  3. include at least one course designated as examining Race, Power, and Privilege (RPP). The RPP curricular program highlights courses that examine issues such as structural inequality, racial formations, disparities of power, and autocritique of academic disciplines. In addition to [RELS 1000]( \"RELS 1000\"), many Religious Studies courses bear this designation. \n\nTo help students create a program of study that balances breadth of focus and approach with attention to the concentrator's particular interests and objectives, concentrators will meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies (or an approved advisor from within the department) when declaring the concentration to discuss their intellectual priorities and provisional course plans. (In the concentration declaration form, concentrators will describe their priorities and plans.) Through these initial discussions as well as advising meetings in subsequent semesters, concentrators and their advisors will work together to recognize and cultivate each concentrator's theoretical, interpretive, or thematic interests.\n### 4. Courses in Other Departments\nCourses cross-listed from other departments and courses listed in other departments but taught by Religious Studies faculty count toward the program of study. Up to two courses taught by faculty in other departments also can count toward the program (pending approval by the DUS) if relevant to the student's program of study. Students who transfer to Brown, study abroad, or otherwise petition to include Brown courses not cross-listed with Religious Studies must complete at least five courses in Religious Studies at Brown.\n### 5. Capstone Project\nIn the final year of study, all concentrators enroll in the department’s Senior Capstone Seminar. Concentrators undertake a capstone project that builds upon a student's previous work in the department and provides a culminating focus for a student's concentration. In extenuating circumstances, a student may petition the DUS to fulfill the capstone within an existing course (subject to approval by its instructor) or an independent study; a concentrator must still enroll in at least nine courses total. Concentrators also may satisfy the capstone requirement by undertaking an honors thesis. Whichever context concentrators choose to complete their capstone within, they will develop a plan for their project no later than the end of the spring semester of the junior year, in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and other faculty as appropriate.\n### Honors Thesis (Optional)\nA thesis is an opportunity for students to conduct extended independent research under the guidance of faculty. If a student chooses to write an honors thesis, in addition to completing the typical seven concentration courses (in addition to [RELS 1000]( \"RELS 1000\")) the student will enroll in [RELS 1995]( \"RELS 1995\") during Fall and [RELS 1999]( \"RELS 1999\") during Spring semester of the senior year. Whether or not a student receives honors, [RELS 1995]( \"RELS 1995\") will serve as the student's capstone course. To be eligible to write a thesis, a student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 (A=4, B=3, C=2) on courses that count toward the concentration. Additionally, to be eligible for honors, concentrators may take no more than two of the concentration courses with the \"S/NC\" option, after declaring a Religious Studies concentration. (Note: if a student is philosophically committed to taking the majority of her or his courses at Brown as \"S/NC,\" that student may petition the Department to waive this \"S/NC\" limit.) Writing the thesis is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for receiving Honors. In order to receive Honors, the student's thesis must earn an A from its two readers, and the student must have earned a grade point average of greater than 3.5 in the concentration and satisfied all other concentration requirements.\nJason Protass, Director of Undergraduate Studies  \nTina Creamer, Departmental Administrator",
  "sast": "# South Asian Studies\n\nSouth Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary concentration in which students work across the humanities and social sciences, geographical locations, and time periods. The concentration emphasizes both the diversity of South Asia as a region, as well as the long-term historical connections among people and places in Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The concentration takes a comparative approach, bringing attention to history, politics, and culture within the region, as well as in the equally vital global South Asian diaspora.\n### Course Requirements\nAll South Asian Studies concentrators must take and pass 10 courses as approved by their concentration advisor.

A prospectus (3-5 pages, describing the major research questions and methods to be used, complete with bibliography) that has been read and vetted by the student’s intended primary reader. \n  2. An email from the faculty member who will serve as primary reader to the South Asian Studies DUS noting their willingness to advise the thesis.\n\nIn addition, students must:\n  1. Enroll in a two-semester sequence of independent study [[SAST 1970]( \"SAST 1970\") or under a relevant departmental course code].\n  2. Designate a second reader by the end of the first month of their 7th semester. Second readers should also confirm their willingness to serve as a reader by sending an email to the South Asian Studies DUS.\n  3. Be in regular contact with thesis advisor about the progress of the project. \n  4. Present their research to the Saxena Center community during their final semester. \n\nFor **mid-year graduating students** , the topic and primary reader must be identified and confirmed by mid-November of the junior year, and a second reader must be arranged and confirmed by January 30 of the senior year.\n* This includes all people listed under the Faculty, Postdoctoral Associate, and Visiting Scholars (limited to those in residence at Brown) tabs on the Saxena Center website\n### Senior-Year Project\nStudents must complete either a senior capstone project OR an honors thesis.\nCapstone projects or honors theses are opportunities for students to creatively synthesize the thinking on South Asia that they have developed during the concentration. The project should exhibit an empirically and theoretically driven research question or argument about some aspect of South Asian Studies. the senior-year project should involve some research in at least one South Asian language.\nAll students are encouraged to start thinking about their capstones in their junior year. \n**Capstones** can take two primary forms:\n  1. A research paper of approximately 30 pages on a topic related to South Asia for an existing concentration-eligible course, undertaken with the permission of the instructor. \n  2. An independent study-based project. the produce and/or process that constitutes this can be artistic, primary or secondary research-based, internship-related, or something else. the project must be supervised by at least one South Asian Studies faculty member* for at least one semester under SAST 1970. This course can count towards the five elective requirement. \n\nAt the end of the junior year, each student should meet with the Director of Undergraduate Study (DUS) to review their plan for completing their capstone. If pursuing a capstone project, students will be required to submit, by the end of the shopping period of the fall of their senior year, a short proposal (300 words) that describes how they are going to complete this requirement.",
  "psyc": "# Psychology\n\nPsychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Fundamental to the study of psychology is analytic methods and critical thinking about the relation between theory and evidence. Studying psychology allows students to understand human and animal behavior, cognitive, perceptual, and developmental processes, motivation, identity, and the relations between well-being and society. Studying psychology also allows students insight into clinical applications of psychological science. Students in the concentration are required to take courses in quantitative methods and experimental design, become familiar with a set of foundational topics in the psychological sciences, and participate in seminars and laboratory courses on specialized topics and state-of-the-art experimental techniques. The concentration in psychology can prepare students for careers in research, teaching, clinical practice, business, law, marketing, and education, among many other professions. The general goal of the psychology concentration requirements is to provide students with a broad exposure to the different areas within psychological science, while also allowing students to explore some of those areas deeply.\n**_These are the new requirements approved by CCC effective Fall 2024. For existing concentrators graduating in 2024-25, the prior requirements can be found by selecting the Bulletin archive<\nCareers in Psychology and related fields require familiarity with statistics. Therefore, the Psychology concentration requires a course in Quantitative Methods ([CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\")).

Consult with a concentration advisor for details. The department does not grant concentration credit for AP Statistics, regardless of score. We strongly recommend fulfilling the statistics requirement as a sophomore.\nAnother element in the Psychology concentration is a course on research methods. Research Methods and Design ([CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\")) or Research Methods ([CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\")) is the preferred course for fulfilling this requirement. This course builds on the introductory statistics course and exposes students to a variety of topics in the psychological sciences: to empirical methods (e.g., surveys, chronometry, eye tracking, brain imaging), to common designs (e.g., factorial experimental, correlational, longitudinal), to research ethics, and to best practices of literature review. Other CPSY laboratory courses can be used to fulfill the research methods requirement; consult with a Psychology advisor for lists of approved courses. Laboratory or research methods courses in other departments cannot be used to fulfill the research methods requirement. The research methods requirement should be fulfilled before senior year. \n**Foundation**\nTo provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in their area of concentration, the Psychology concentration requires five foundation courses, representing core areas of Psychology as a science. Foundation courses are all numbered below the 1000 level. The list of approved foundation courses is posted on the CPSY undergraduate page. CPSY courses above the 1000 level and courses in other departments, at any level, cannot be used to satisfy foundation requirements. \n**Electives**\nConcentrators will select four additional courses that examine in greater depth topics of special interest to them. The CPSY courses designed to count as electives will often have foundation courses as prerequisites. Electives can be chosen from laboratory courses, lecture courses, or seminars. At least two electives should be at the 1000 level in the CPSY department. In addition, students may choose up to two courses outside of CPSY (preferably at the 1000 level) as electives. Electives should fit into a coherent intellectual theme, and should be chosen in consultation with a concentration advisor. \n### Requirements for the A.B. degree\nSTANDARD PROGRAM FOR THE A.B.

Laboratory or research methods courses in other departments cannot be used to fulfill the research methods requirement. The research methods requirement should be fulfilled before senior year. \n**Foundation**\nTo provide students with a solid foundation of knowledge in their area of concentration, the Psychology concentration requires five foundation courses, representing core areas of Psychology as a science. Foundation courses are all numbered below the 1000 level. The list of approved foundation courses is posted on the CPSY undergraduate page. CPSY courses above the 1000 level and courses in other departments, at any level, cannot be used to satisfy foundation requirements. \n**Electives**\nConcentrators will select four additional courses that examine in greater depth topics of special interest to them. The CPSY courses designed to count as electives will often have foundation courses as prerequisites. Electives can be chosen from laboratory courses, lecture courses, or seminars. At least two electives should be at the 1000 level in the CPSY department. In addition, students may choose up to two courses outside of CPSY (preferably at the 1000 level) as electives. Electives should fit into a coherent intellectual theme, and should be chosen in consultation with a concentration advisor. \n### **_Additional ScB Requirements in Psychology_**\nTo satisfy an ScB. in the Psychology concentration, one must satisfy all the AB requirements as well as take five (5) additional classes in STEM fields related to the concentration. The goal of this requirement is to provide students with a broader background in both the study of psychology and STEM fields in general. At least two (2) of those five classes must be in the CPSY Department. These two courses must be at the 1000-level. We strongly recommend that one of these courses be a laboratory course.\nThe other three classes can be from the following departments: APMA, BIOL, CSCI, CHEM, CPSY, MATH, NEUR, or PHYS. Courses from other STEM departments might be eligible with permission of your concentration advisor, but such courses must be related to a student’s other courses, such as their electives. All courses must also be acceptable for the concentration requirements of a concentration administered by that department. For example, if a PHYS course is used to satisfy one of these requirements, it must be acceptable for a concentration in the PHYS department. \n### Requirements Specific for the Sc.B. degree\nSTANDARD PROGRAM FOR THE Sc.B.

The program also provides the opportunity for outstanding senior concentrators to receive their undergraduate degree with Honors. Participation in the program allows students to develop an understanding of research and acquire research skills and background. \nCandidates for Honors in Psychology must meet all of the requirements of the concentration as described above. Candidates submit their application for the program in semester 7. We encourage students to seek out a potential faculty mentor prior to semester 7. Candidates for Honors must have completed the Statistics [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") and Research Methods and Design ([CPSY 1900]( \"CPSY 1900\"), Research Methods [CPSY 1901]( \"CPSY 1901\"), or laboratory course) requirements before semester 7. Please refer to the CPSY Honors Program page for detailed information about the specific requirements for the Honors program in Psychology.",
  "urbn": "# Urban Studies\n\nThe Urban Studies Program equips students to analyze the city and urban life in the United States and around the planet through a variety of disciplinary lenses drawn from the humanities and social sciences, applying both qualitative and quantitative methods for scholarly research and community engagement. Cities are sites of problems and promise, inequality and solidarity, conflict and community. Processes of urbanization shape the challenges and possibilities of the 21st century. Urban Studies students explore the history of cities, urban and suburban growth and transformation, the organization and design of built, social, and natural environments, urban politics and policy, and the role of cities and urbanization in art, culture, and public life. The undergraduate program emphasizes global and local perspectives to understand how diverse communities have shaped cities through time, investigates the spatial dimensions of social relations and cultural meaning, and challenges students to work towards inclusive, equitable, and sustainable places.\nThrough experiences both inside and outside the classroom, Urban Studies concentrators learn to analyze urban life and the built environment through a variety of disciplinary lenses, to think creatively and critically about both the problems and potential of cities, and to use evidence-based approaches to address real-world issues. Above all, our students are dedicated to understanding, envisioning and creating cities that are inclusive and sustainable. An Urban Studies degree prepares students for a wide range of [careers]( with our [graduates]( going on to work in government, the non-profit sector, business, law, education, planning and design, public health and medicine, academia, media and technology, and the arts. \nFor a concentration, the program requires ten courses selected from four course groups:\nIntroduction (choose one): | 1

  "stat": "# Statistics\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics is designed to provide foundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. To ensure deep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts: a) foundations in mathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statistical thinking and practice; b) four core courses on the fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis; and c) more advanced material covering important areas of statistical methodology. A capstone project involving substantial data analysis or focused on methodology/theory is required. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experience in study design, data management, and statistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participating academic departments or Research Centers at Brown.\nThe Concentration is based on several premises: that statistics is a scientific discipline in its own right, with specialized methodologies and body of knowledge; that it is essentially concerned with the art and science of data analysis; and that it is best taught in conjunction with specific, substantive applications. To this end, the Concentration is designed to provide foundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. The Concentration prepares students for careers in industry and government, for graduate study in statistics or biostatistics and other sciences, as well as for professional study in law, medicine, business, or public administration. The undergraduate concentration guide is available [here]( \nThe Undergraduate Concentration in Statistics is administered by the Department of Biostatistics and leads to a Sc.B. degree. To ensure deep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts. The first part entails foundations in mathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statistical thinking and practice. The second part includes four core courses that provide a comprehensive account of the fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis. The third part delves into more advanced material covering important areas of statistical methodology. In addition to the formal coursework, students are required to complete a capstone project that involves a substantial data analysis or a methodological/theoretical project. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experience in study design, data management, and statistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participating academic Departments or Research Centers at Brown. \nThe program requires **thirteen** one-semester courses.

Students that decide to write an honor thesis will generally integrate their capstone project into their thesis. Generally, writing a senior thesis includes two semesters of independent study ([PHP 1980]( \"PHP 1980\")), the capstone project may serve as one of those.\n**_Honors:_**\nStatistics requires the completion of a senior thesis and a superior record in the program. \n_**Study Abroad/Study Away**_ : Up to two courses taken elsewhere (study abroad or other transfer) may be applied to required courses. Meet with a concentration adviser to discuss; provide a syllabus for each course to be considered for transfer to your concentration plan.\nThe program is administered by the Department of Biostatistics, located at 121 South Main Street, 7th floor.\nFor additional information please contact: Roee Gutman, Box G-S-121-7; Telephone: 401-863-2682; Fax: 401-863-9182; e-mail: Roee Gutman",
  "slav": "# Slavic Studies\n\nSlavic Studies is concerned with the languages, literatures, and civilizations of the Slavic world. Built on sound knowledge of one or two Slavic languages (normally Russian or Czech) the program allows students to develop an in-depth appreciation and understanding of East European cultures and civilizations through a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary fields. Students take courses in literature, history, culture, theater, political science, economics, and international relations. Concentrators focusing on Russia learn one of the world’s most commonly spoken languages and study some of the world’s best-regarded authors and composers: Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Gogol and Bulgakov, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, and Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky. Focusing on Czech allows students to explore, for example, how Czechs distinguished themselves by peacefully transitioning from communism to capitalism (the “Velvet Revolution”) and separating peacefully with the Slovak Republic (the “Velvet Divorce”). Most concentrators study abroad in a Slavic country, either during the academic year or the summer.\n### Requirements for the AB Degree\nSix semesters of one Slavic language or the equivalent, or a combined total of eight semesters of two Slavic languages or the equivalent. |   \n---|---  \n[RUSS 0100]( \"RUSS 0100\")  \n& [RUSS 0200]( \"RUSS 0200\") | Introductory Russian  \nand Introductory Russian |   \nor [RUSS 0110]( \"RUSS 0110\") |  Intensive Russian  \n[RUSS 0300]( \"RUSS 0300\")  \n& [RUSS 0400]( \"RUSS 0400\") | Intermediate Russian  \nand Intermediate Russian |   \n[RUSS 0500]( \"RUSS 0500\")  \n& [RUSS 0600]( \"RUSS 0600\") | Advanced Russian  \nand Advanced Russian |   \nIn cases where a student's interests and course of study warrant it, and only upon consulting the concentration advisor, the student may apply more than one Slavic language to the concentration (Czech or Polish in addition to Russian), and would then need a combined total of eight semesters of two Slavic languages:  |   \n[CZCH 0100]( \"CZCH 0100\")  \n& [CZCH 0200]( \"CZCH 0200\") | Introductory Czech  \nand Introductory Czech |   \n[CZCH 0400]( \"CZCH 0400\")  \n& [RUSS 0300]( \"RUSS 0300\") | Intermediate Czech  \nand Intermediate Russian |   \n[PLSH 0100]( \"PLSH 0100\")  \n& [PLSH 0200]( \"PLSH 0200\") | Introductory Polish  \nand Introductory Polish |   \n[PLSH 0300]( \"PLSH 0300\")  \n& [PLSH 0400]( \"PLSH 0400\") | Intermediate Polish  \nand Intermediate Polish |   \nThe concentration in Slavic Studies requires students to complete a minimum of seven 1000-level courses devoted to the study of the East European civilizations: literature, history, culture, theater, political science, economics, international relations.

  "taps": "# Theatre Arts and Performance Studies\n\nThe Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies (TAPS) is the intellectual and artistic center for the aesthetic, historical, literary, practical, and theoretical explorations of performance in global perspective – theatre, dance, speech, time-based art, and even performative “roles” in everyday life. The TAPS concentration offers three tracks with many points of overlap among them: Performance Studies, Theatre Arts, and Dance. Concentrators gain exposure to a broad spectrum of performance modes and methods -- acting, directing, dance, and writing, and chose an avenue of focus among them. Everyone graduates having studied craft, gained familiarity with history, and investigated the role of performance arts in culture.\n### Theatre Arts Track\nThis concentration combines the study of dramatic literature, theatre history, performance theory, and studio work in the various theatre arts. All concentrators in Theatre Arts will gain practical experience through the study of acting and directing as well as in the technical production of plays, preparing students in the practical study of a cross-section of the vital aspects of theatre craft, including one class in either dance or speech. An essential aim of the concentration track is the engagement of students in performance procedures (acting, dancing, directing, choreography, design, playwriting, dramaturgy, etc.) in order to experience the inter-relationships among social contexts, dramatic texts and theatrical enactments. Along with practical study in craft, concentrators will graduate having studied theatre history and performance theory in global perspective.  The study of theatre history provides a Theatre Arts concentrator with the necessary background to understand a variety of dramatic and theatrical forms. The study of performance theory enhances a student’s ability to ask fundamental questions about the role of theatre in social, political, cultural and cross-cultural arenas.\nStudents wishing to enroll as concentrators in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and take the Theatre Arts track should see the undergraduate Theatre Arts track advisor, in order to discuss options that will best serve their interests.\nBasic Theatre Arts Track Requirements -- 10 Credits |   \n---|---  \n[TAPS 0700]( \"TAPS 0700\") | Introduction to Theatre, Dance and Performance (Required Courses) | 1  \n[TAPS 0230]( \"TAPS 0230\") | Acting | 1  \nor [TAPS 0220]( \"TAPS 0220\") |  Persuasive Communication  \n[TAPS 0250]( \"TAPS 0250\") | Introduction to Technical Theatre and Production | 1  \n[TAPS 1230]( \"TAPS 1230\") | Global Theatre and Performance: Paleolithic to the Threshold of Modernity | 1  \n[TAPS 1240]( \"TAPS 1240\") | Performance Historiography and Theatre History | 1  \n[TAPS 1250]( \"TAPS 1250\") | Late Modern and Contemporary Theatre and Performance | 1  \nTheatre Studies electives: 4 elective courses, one of which must be theory, history, or literature chosen in consultation with the advisor according to the area of interest (i.e., acting, direction, playwriting, design/technical theatre). Additionally, following consultation with the advisor, one of the electives may be taken outside the TAPS department.  | 4   \nTotal Credits | 10  \n### Performance Studies Track\nThe Performance Studies track in the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies concentration offers a base for students interested in a variety of performance forms, performance media, or in intermedial art. A concentrator in this track will study the multiple modes in which live performance articulates culture, negotiates difference, constructs identity, and transmits collective historical traditions and memories. Because Performance Studies is not primarily invested in one performance mode over another (such as theatre or dance), a concentrator will gain exposure to a broad spectrum of performance modes. Studying ritual, play, game, festival, spectacle and a broad spectrum of “performance behaviors” under the umbrella of Performance Studies, a concentrator will graduate having investigated the role of performance in culture, including performative acts in everyday life, political enactment, ritual behavior, aesthetic or representational practices, and social role or the performance of subjectivity. The history of aesthetic performance practices (such as the histories of theatre and/or dance) will be an important part of this track, serving to ground inquiry into the broader spectrum of performance study. Students will craft their electives on this track from a wide selection of courses both within the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and across the university. The study of performance behavior across mediums such as dance, theatre, ritual, and orature allows for geographic and historical flexibility as not all cultures parse theatre from dance, nor, historically, genres of religious or political ritual from genres of entertainment, play, or game. At least one of the ten required classes must show geographic or cultural breadth, and be approved as such by the undergraduate concentration advisor. Participation in practical classes in modes of performance is also required.\nStudents wishing to enroll as concentrators in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies and take the Performance Studies track should see the undergraduate Performance Studies track advisor, in order to discuss options that will best serve their interests.\nBasic Performance Studies Track Requirements -- 10 credits |   \n---|---  \n[TAPS 0700]( \"TAPS 0700\") | Introduction to Theatre, Dance and Performance | 1  \nThree of the following courses:  | 3   \n[TAPS 1230]( \"TAPS 1230\") | Global Theatre and Performance: Paleolithic to the Threshold of Modernity |   \n[TAPS 1240]( \"TAPS 1240\") | Performance Historiography and Theatre History |   \n[TAPS 1250]( \"TAPS 1250\") | Late Modern and Contemporary Theatre and Performance |   \n[TAPS 1280Y]( \"TAPS 1280Y\") | Issues in Performance Studies |   \nTwo primarily academic courses from within the Department with Performance Studies content to be selected with your advisor, such as (but not limited to):  | 2  \n[TAPS 0800I]( \"TAPS 0800I\") | (Re)Imagining the Body: What can a Body do? |   \n[TAPS 1280E]( \"TAPS 1280E\") | Neurodiversity and Performance |   \n[TAPS 1281G]( \"TAPS 1281G\") | Queer Dance |   \n[TAPS 1281O]( \"TAPS 1281O\") | Acting Outside the Box: Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality in Performance |   \n[TAPS 1281Q]( \"TAPS 1281Q\") | Introduction to Critical Dance Studies |   \n[TAPS 1425]( \"TAPS 1425\") | Queer Performance |   \n[TAPS 1500P]( \"TAPS 1500P\") | Asian American Theater Making |   \n[TAPS 1600]( \"TAPS 1600\") | Dramaturgy  |   \n[TAPS 1670]( \"TAPS 1670\") | Latinx Theatre + Performance |   \nTwo full-credit courses based in performance craft in either Dance, Acting, Directing, Playwriting, Speech, Design, Literary Arts, Visual Arts, Music, or Africana Studies approved by the concentration advisor. | 2   \nTwo additional courses in the academic study of performance and performance culture(s) from either within TAPS or throughout the University in consultation with the advisor.  | 2   \nTotal Credits | 10  \n### Dance Track\nThe Dance track of the Theatre Arts and Performance Studies concentration engages students in the study of dance, movement, and other forms of kinesthetic performance.

The purpose of the capstone is to synthesize the core tenets of theory and practice from our concentration learning objectives in the form of a student-initiated creative project, experience, or a non-honors research paper. Students pursuing Honors fulfill the capstone requirement by successfully completing a senior thesis (see Honors section).\nPlease note that while the experience being reflected on for the Capstone may occur as early as the junior year, the reflective paper must be written and submitted in the senior year.\nThe 5-page reflection paper must be written and submitted in the final semester of the senior year, and completes the capstone requirement. The following options can qualify as the experiential component of a capstone project, and can be executed during junior or senior year.\n  * Participation in a Senior Slot Production. \n  * Major participation in a TAPS Department / Sock & Buskin Production. (i.e. acting, assistant directing, designer, dramaturg, stage manager) \n  * Extension of an existing curricular, co-curricular, or extra-curricular project. \n  * Revision or expansion of an existing final paper from any prior TAPS theory or history class. \n  * Major participation in a non-departmental campus production, performance or academic event. (i.e. [student theatre, student dance]( [group]( self-produced performance or event at the Granoff)\n\nStudents must create a Capstone project plan in consultation with the TAPS DUS. Finalized project proposals must be submitted via email for approval by the DUS no later than October 1st for students graduating in spring, and September 15th for students graduating in fall.\nCapstone proposals must be approved the TAPS DUS.\n#### **Capstone Reflection Paper Due Dates**\n  * For students graduating in spring, the capstone reflection paper is due March 1st of the senior year.\n  * For students graduating in fall, the capstone reflection paper is due November 1st of the senior year.\n\n#### **Capstone Reflection Paper**\nPlease email the DUS a 5-page reflection paper addressing the following writing points:\n  * A brief description of the project completed, including details about who, what, when and where the project took place. If you revised a paper, detail which class the paper was originally written for; and how you revised the paper, etc. \n  * An examination of how you used knowledge, skills and research methods acquired in the concentration to conceptualize, do and complete the project, with a frank assessment of the project’s success or ways in which it could have been improved.\n\nThe DUS will assess and approve the paper if all of the criteria above are met. The reflection will be assessed for clarity, honesty and depth of self-reflection and encapsulation of your experience of the TAPS curriculum.\n**Please note:** Students should refer to the Brown Arts Institute [student funding]( opportunities and consult with the staff regarding space availability and support.\n* * *\n### Senior Honors Thesis\nHonors are awarded for theses in all concentration tracks, and satisfies the capstone requirement. Candidates for the senior honors program should have an outstanding academic record, must apply to the Department for approval, and enroll in TAPS 1990 in Semesters VII and VIII. All theses are substantive pieces of writing. Some theses are strictly academic. Other honors theses may include a creative component (such as the directing of a play, a solo performance piece, the study and performance of a major role, or the design of a production) but the thesis itself will include a critical, written work based in research relative to that artwork. For creative work submitted for honors, the essay should accompany the play/ performance, reporting on the research and the process of creation although the play/ performance itself can count as the substantive written work. Please note that departmental support is not available for productions at this time.\nStudents should refer to the Brown Arts Institute [student funding]( opportunities and consult with the staff regarding space availability and support.\nStudents should contact the honors advisor by the end of Semester V to discuss proposals, thesis guidelines, and scheduling TAPS 1990 the honors thesis course in Semesters VII and VIII.\n  * For students graduating in spring submit proposals to the Department in Semester VI by April 1st.\n\n  * For students graduating in fall submit proposals to the Department in Semester VI by October 1st.\n\nProposals should be submitted electronically to taps@brown.edu.",
  "sar": "# Social Analysis and Research\n\nThe Sc.B. concentration in Social Analysis and Research provides both a conceptual and a working knowledge of the techniques for data collection and analysis used for social research in academic and non-academic environments. The centerpiece of the concentration is a rigorous and comprehensive collection of courses: (1) that develop an understanding of the principles underlying the processes of data collection and analysis; and (2) that train students in the application of advanced statistical techniques for data description and analysis. The concepts and skills learned in these courses are reinforced through engagement in applied research with Sociology faculty and/or internships with local organizations in the for profit and not-for-profit sectors.\nConcentrators also take courses that provide grounding in the theoretical approaches to social phenomena that are foundational to social research. Graduates develop an understanding of the concepts and processes that underlie the issues studied by sociologists and the analytic techniques that allow sociologists to understand social relations and individual behavior.\n### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree\nRequired core: |   \n---|---  \n[MATH 0090]( \"MATH 0090\") | Single Variable Calculus, Part I | 1  \n[SOC 1100]( \"SOC 1100\") | Introductory Statistics for Social Research | 1  \nor [APMA 0650]( \"APMA 0650\") |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics  \nor [ECON 1620]( \"ECON 1620\") |  Introduction to Econometrics  \n[SOC 1020]( \"SOC 1020\") | Methods of Social Research | 1  \n[SOC 2010]( \"SOC 2010\") | Multivariate Statistical Methods I | 1  \n[SOC 1010]( \"SOC 1010\") | Classical Sociological Theory | 1  \n[SOC 1950]( \"SOC 1950\") | Senior Seminar | 1  \nThree (3) substantive or theory courses (non-methodological courses) in Sociology, two (2) of which must be at the 1000-level or above. | 3  \nThree (3) of the following advanced analysis courses: | 3  \n[SOC 1117]( \"SOC 1117\") | Focus Groups for Market and Social Research  |   \n[SOC 1118]( \"SOC 1118\") | Context Research for Innovation |   \n[SOC 1120]( \"SOC 1120\") | Market and Social Surveys |   \n[SOC 1260]( \"SOC 1260\") | Market Research in Public and Private Sectors |   \n[SOC 1340]( \"SOC 1340\") | Principles and Methods of Geographic Information Systems |   \n[SOC 1872N]( \"SOC 1872N\") | Ethnography in Organizations |   \n[SOC 2020]( \"SOC 2020\") | Multivariate Statistical Methods II |   \n[SOC 2070]( \"SOC 2070\") | Text as Data for Social Science Research |   \n[SOC 2210]( \"SOC 2210\") | Qualitative Methods |   \n[SOC 2230]( \"SOC 2230\") | Techniques of Demographic Analysis |   \n[SOC 2240]( \"SOC 2240\") | Event History Analysis |   \n[SOC 2250]( \"SOC 2250\") | Ethnography: Theory and Practice |   \n[SOC 2260T]( \"SOC 2260T\") | Cultural Theory and Methods |   \n[SOC 2610]( \"SOC 2610\") | Spatial Thinking in Social Science |   \n[SOC 2612]( \"SOC 2612\") | Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis for the Social Sciences |   \n[SOC 2960G]( \"SOC 2960G\") | Spatial Data Analysis Techniques in the Social Sciences |   \n[SOC 2960Y]( \"SOC 2960Y\") | Causal Analysis |   \n[SOC 2961A]( \"SOC 2961A\") | Advanced Spatial Data Analysis Techniques in the Social Sciences  |   \nResearch experience (1 course) | 0-1  \nA one-semester research internship (not for credit or for credit as [SOC 1970]( \"SOC 1970\") - Independant Study), or a summer research internship (not for credit). |   \nTotal Credits | 12-13  \nA one semester or a summer research internship is required.

How do emotions shape our political behavior?Would less government lead to more social justice? What is social justice? How does smuggling (of drugs, guns, and people) reshape international relations? How does climate change affect politics? Do states or multinational corporations call the shots in the global economy?\nPolitical science is about questions like these. You can grapple with every one of them -- and many more -- in the classrooms of the Brown Political Science Department. We study how people -- nations, regions, cities, communities -- live their common lives. How people solve (or duck) their common problems. How people govern themselves. How they think, talk, argue, fight, and vote. We seek to develop understandings of institutions, ideas, practices, and relations that constitute public life, and modes of inquiry that promote citizenship.\nTen courses are required overall from within the Department of Political Science. If you satisfy the methods requirement outside the department then you will need to add another POLS course. If you double count a course for two requirements, then you will also need to add a POLS course.

  "soc": "# Sociology\n\nThe concentration in Sociology (leading to a Bachelor of Arts) provides a foundation in sociological theory and methods and the opportunity to cultivate more specialized knowledge in the discipline’s substantive interests. Students develop that focus through their coursework, taking courses in diverse areas such as social inequality, family and gender, organizations, environmental sociology, race and ethnicity and globalization. Students refine their interests during the senior seminar and through their completion of a senior thesis or capstone project.\n### Standard program for the A.B. degree\nTen courses are required to complete the concentration.\nRequired core: |   \n---|---  \n[SOC 0010]( \"SOC 0010\") | Social Forces: An Introduction to Sociology | 1  \n[SOC 1010]( \"SOC 1010\") | Classical Sociological Theory | 1  \n[SOC 1020]( \"SOC 1020\") | Methods of Social Research | 1  \n[SOC 1100]( \"SOC 1100\") | Introductory Statistics for Social Research | 1  \nor [APMA 0650]( \"APMA 0650\") |  Introduction to Probability and Statistics  \nor [ECON 1620]( \"ECON 1620\") |  Introduction to Econometrics  \nor [CPSY 0900]( \"CPSY 0900\") |  Statistical Methods  \n[SOC 1950]( \"SOC 1950\") | Senior Seminar | 1  \nFive (5) additional courses: | 5  \na) At least three of the optional courses have to be 1000 level and one of them must be a substantive seminar (1870-1873). |   \nb) Students can choose to take up to two lower level (0100 level) courses. |   \nc) Students can petition to take two courses outside of the discipline (this will be allowed only when the proposed course makes sense given the interests of the student, and there is no equivalent sociology course). |   \nTotal Credits | 10  \n### Honors\nIn order to be considered for honors, students must (1) be in good standing with the College, (2) have completed at least half of the concentration coursework, and have earned a majority of “A” grades in the concentration.

The purpose of the thesis or capstone project is to allow students an opportunity to apply the knowledge they acquired through the concentration curriculum on a topic of their own interests. (Students in the Organizational Studies track are expected to focus their senior thesis or capstone project on an Organizational Studies topic.) To fulfill this requirement students enroll in SOC 1950 – Senior Seminar. Participation in this seminar allows each cohort of concentrators to discuss their diverse interests and expose students to the wide range of applications of Sociological knowledge.\nA **senior thesis** must ask an original research question, answer it with appropriate evidence, and place that work within relevant scholarly literature in sociology. The thesis is supervised by a faculty member who serves as the primary advisor and one additional faculty member who serves as a reader. By the end of the sixth semester, students must submit a prospectus for the senior thesis (not more than four pages) accompanied by the signature of one faculty member indicating that he or she is willing to serve as the primary advisor on the thesis to the Director of Undergraduate Studies in their concentration. Only a senior thesis qualifies the student for Honors.\nA **capstone project** is an independent, student-initiated project or experience developed during the Senior Seminar (SOC 1950) that connects in a meaningful way to learning in the concentration. A capstone project differs from a thesis in its scholarly content and form, and it depends only on the evaluation of the senior seminar instructor. Whereas the senior thesis follows the form of a conventional research paper, the capstone project allows a wider array of research and creative outputs, including but not limited to video documentaries, photographic exhibitions, and applied or policy-related reports for an off-campus organization. Projects are complemented by a poster presentation, literature review, and report that situates the central subject matter of the project within the context of sociological scholarship.\n### Independent Study\nStudents can use no more than one (1) Independent Study course ([SOC 1970]( to meet the concentration course requirements. This course counts towards a 1000-level substantive requirement and will not serve as a substitute for any of the core concentration requirements.\n### Honors\nIn order to be considered for honors, students must (1) be in good standing with the College, (2) have completed at least half of the concentration coursework, and have earned a majority of “A” grades in the concentration. Honors also require a senior thesis, with a recommendation of Honors by the advisor and reader, that demonstrates an understanding of empirical research."
